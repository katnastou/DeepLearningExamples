The overexpression of Buffy and Debcl in DA neurons results in a longer lifespan and improved locomotor ability (Fig. 2). The median lifespan of these flies was 62 days when compared to Buffy and lacZ overexpressing controls at 68 days. The median survival of Debcl-RNAi flies was 68 days as determined by a Log-rank (Mantel-Cox) test (Fig. 2C). The climbing ability of these flies was also much improved as determined by comparing the climbing indices at 95% CI (Fig. 2D). Taken together these results suggest that Buffy antagonizes the Debcl-induced phenotypes of shortened lifespan and poor climbing ability to markedly improve "healthspan."
