Our results suggest that the two isoforms might replace each other under certain conditions. According to Han et al. p38a and p38b appear to have partial functional redundancy, because both isoforms are similarly activated in response to stress-inducing or inflammatory stimuli in cell culture experiments. This compensatory mechanism may be vital for the flies, when one of the two isoforms lacks completely. But the compensatory mechanism may be elusive when one isoform is only down-regulated in specific neurons that are not necessary for survival (e.g. the clock neurons): Lengthened free-running rhythms in DD just occurred, when either p38b or p38a levels in clock neurons were reduced, but not completely absent from the entire fly. We therefore suppose that either isoform overtakes the clock specific function of the other one only in its complete absence. As p38a mRNA levels were not increased in p38bDelta45 flies and p38b mRNA levels were not elevated in p38aDelta1 (Fig. S8), normal wildtype p38a or p38b levels seem to be sufficient to drive circadian rhythms in complete absence of the other isoform.
