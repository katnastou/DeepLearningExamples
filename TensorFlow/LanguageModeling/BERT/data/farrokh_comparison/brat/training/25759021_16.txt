Since RNF5 is implicated in the clearance of misfolded proteins as part of the ERAD response, we asked whether RNF5 interaction with Gln-carrier proteins required changes in protein folding following ERS. To do so, we subjected BCa cells to 35S-methionine-cysteine-based labeling followed by immunopurification of 35S-labeled SLC1A5 and limited proteolytic cleavage using BNPS-Skatole. SDS-PAGE analysis followed by autoradiography revealed a marked decrease in SLC1A5 cleavage prior but not following paclitaxel treatment (Figure 4G, S4B). These findings suggest that SLC1A5 undergoes misfolding following ERS, consistent with RNF5 recognition of misfolded proteins at the ER membrane. RNF5 KD attenuated paclitaxel-induced SLC1A5/38A2 degradation (Figure 4H). Likewise, the half-lives of both SLC1A5/38A2 increased after RNF5 KD in paclitaxel-treated MDA-MB-231 cells (Figure 4I).
