A) Western blot analyses of TIP-1 expression in D54, U87 and T98G cells in which TIP-1 protein expression was genetically manipulated with recombinant plasmids or shRNA respectively. Two independent shRNA sequences were used for TIP-1 knockdown. B) Survival fractions of D54, U87 and T98G cells after single dose X-ray radiation treatment were determined with clonogenic assays. Vector control and parental cells were included in the assays. Shown are representative data from at least three independent experiments performed in triplicate.
