The discovery that Dph3 is an electron donor in diphthamide biosynthesis is the first time that the physiological role of a member from the CSL zinc finger family is convincingly demonstrated, paving the road for understanding the function of this protein family. In the Pfam database, the CSL type zinc finger family (PF05207) is listed with 560 sequences from 303 species, but no definite function has been assigned to CSL zinc fingers. In the 560 sequences, 307 sequences have only the CSL zinc finger domain like Dph3. Among the 303 species that contain CSL zinc finger proteins, there are 296 eukaryotes and 7 bacteria. As diphthamide modification only exits in archaea and eukaryotes, proteins in this family must have functions other than diphthamide biosynthesis. Knowing the electron-donor activity of Dph3 will help to understand the functions of other CSL zinc finger proteins.
