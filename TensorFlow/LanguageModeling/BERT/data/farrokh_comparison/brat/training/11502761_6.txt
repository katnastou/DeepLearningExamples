The brain-specific synaptotagmin 1 member of the synaptotagmin family appears to exhibit tissue-specific endocytosis, a relatively rare phenomenon. Although synaptotagmin 1 is readily internalized by the neuronal-like PC12 cells, in transfected fibroblasts it was found mostly on the cell surface. This suggested that cells of the neuroendocrine lineage possess an endocytotic mechanism lacking in nonneuronal cells. To try to understand this mechanism, we have examined the internalization of synaptotagmin 1 and its chimeras into neuronal and nonneuronal cell lines. Surprisingly, the AP2 binding site in the C2B domain is not needed for internalization of chimeras. By contrast, we find evidence for an internalization signal in the COOH-terminal domain of synaptotagmin 1. The internalization signal is sufficient to mediate internalization of chimeras in the absence of the C2B domain, and can be recognized by the endocytotic machinery even in nonneuronal cells. The C2B domain acts as a regulator of internalization since in fibroblast cells it normally conceals the synaptotagmin 1 internalization signal. In PC12 cells, little inhibition of the COOH-terminal internalization signal by the C2B domain is seen unless mutations are made in the C2B domain, in particular in a dilysine motif that has already been implicated in endocytosis by the synprint experiments of. Endocytosis of synaptotagmin 1 appears to be controlled by a latent internalization signal that is activated by a neuroendocrine-specific mechanism acting via the C2B domain. Thus, synaptotagmin 1 internalization resembles ligand-activated endocytosis of surface receptors, except that the activation is intracellular.
