To test if Cbr1 could reduce Dph3 in vitro, we cloned, expressed and purified the recombinant Cbr1. We first monitored the reduction of Dph3 by detecting the 488 nm absorption of oxidized Dph3 as previously described. Upon addition of NADH to initiate the reaction, Dph3 was rapidly reduced by Cbr1 (Fig. 1b). In contrast, addition of NADPH did not lead to reduction of Dph3, suggesting that Cbr1 is an NADH-specific enzyme (Supplementary Fig. 3). To confirm Cbr1's role as a Dph3 reductase, we tested if this reduction system can be used to reduce Dph1-Dph2 and reconstitute the first step of diphthamide biosynthesis in vitro. Using C-SAM, the substrate eEF2 was radioactively labeled in the presence of Dph1-Dph2, Dph3, Cbr1 and NADH (Fig. 1c, and Supplementary Fig. 7, lane3). The Cbr1/NADH/Dph3 reduction system was able to reduce Dph1-Dph2 similarly to dithionite, a chemical reductant for Fe-S clusters (Fig. 1c, and Supplementary Fig. 7, lane 1). These results demonstrated that Cbr1 can reduce Dph3 using NADH in vitro.
