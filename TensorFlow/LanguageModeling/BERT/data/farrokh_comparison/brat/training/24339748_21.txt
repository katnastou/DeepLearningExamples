First, we verified the degradation of MED19a in the presence of HaRxL44 in Arabidopsis, by generating a transgenic line expressing both GFP-MED19a and 3HA-Strep2-HaRxL44 (or 3HA-Strep2-GUS as control). We showed that, as we observed in N. benthamiana, MED19a is degraded in the presence of HaRxL44 in Arabidopsis and the addition of MG132 blocks the effect of HaRxL44 on MED19a stability (Figure S5D). We then investigated whether the presence of HaRxL44 affects the interaction between MED19a and the Mediator complex. We found that, even in the presence of 3HA-HaRxL44, MED6 co-immunoprecipitates with GFP-MED19a in Arabidopsis (Figure S5E), suggesting that MED6 and GFP-MED19a also associate in the nucleolus. However, overproduction of MED19a and HaRxL44 in Arabidopsis may affect the stoichiometry or nuclear/nucleolar distribution of interactions between MED19a and the Mediator complex, or Mediator subcomplexes, obscuring potential effects of HaRxL44 on the integration or stability of MED19a subunits in the Mediator complex.
