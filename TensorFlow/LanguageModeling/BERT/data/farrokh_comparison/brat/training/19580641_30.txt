TGF-beta3 plays a role as an inhibitor of MEE proliferation during palatal fusion and an inducer of apoptosis. Using Ki67 as a marker for proliferation we did not observe increased proliferation in E14.5 and E15.5 palates of the Jeff homozygote MEE. However, we also stained for apoptotic cells using a caspase-3 antibody and found many fewer positive cells in Jeff homozygote E15.5 palates. It appears that in the presence of a mutation in Fbxo11, palatal fusion is inhibited and MEE cells are not able to progress to epithelial programmed cell death or epithelial-mesenchymal transformation.
