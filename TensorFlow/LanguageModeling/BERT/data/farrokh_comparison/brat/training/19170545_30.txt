These results, together with the substrate activities of the acyl-CoAs reported in the previous section, suggest that hTHEM2 requires CoA as the substrate thiol unit, which in turn demands that hTHEM2 has a CoA binding site. We tested this prediction by measuring the inhibition constant of the CoA analog desulfoCoA, in which the CH2SH is replaced with CH3. Because the activity assay is based on measuring CoA formation using DTNB, CoA itself could not be tested. The desulfoCoA was shown to be tight binding competitive inhibitor of hTHEM2 catalysis (Ki = 9 muM; Table 2).
