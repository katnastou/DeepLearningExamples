The full-length cDNA of CG4454 (borr) and CG17009 (aust) was amplified by PCR using primers that include BamHI and HindIII restriction enzyme sites at the 5' and 3' ends, respectively. cDNAs were cloned into pGEM-T, sequenced to confirm the identity of the products, and subsequently subcloned into the bacterial expression vector pMAL-c2x using the BamHI and HindIII restriction sites. The MBP-tagged proteins were purified as described previously. To express genes in mammalian tissue culture cells, full-length INCENP and aurora B were amplified and cloned into a pGEM-T vector and fully sequenced before subcloning into either HA-tagged pCDEF3 or FLAG-tagged pCDEF3 using NdeI and NotI restriction sites. The expression of transgenes in mammalian cells was performed as described previously.
