The Duolink in situ Proximity Ligation Assay (DPLA, Olink Bioscience, Uppsala, Sweden) was used according to the manufacturer's protocol (www.olink.com/products-services/duolink) to detect the interaction between Prdx6 and piGST in intact cells. PMVEC from Prdx6 null mice were grown to 70% confluence on glass coverslips and transfected with constructs expressing wild type or mutated Prdx6 ZsGreen vector using the Amaxa Nucleofector system (program T-023) and the Basic Endothelial Nucleofector Kit (Lonza Group, Basel, Switzerland) according to the manufacturer's protocol. MCF7 cells were transfected with human piGST using the GenJet transfection reagent. Cells were cultured for an additional 48 h after transfection.
