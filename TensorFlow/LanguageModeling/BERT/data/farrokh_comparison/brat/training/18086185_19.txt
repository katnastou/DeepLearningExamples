Our SPR data have established the stoichiometry of the Dr adhesin/N-CEA complex to be 1:1. Based on the chemical shift perturbation data combined with available mutagenesis data, an initial model of a 1:1 complex was constructed by the HADDOCK approach using the solution structure of AfaE-dsc and the crystal structure of N-CEA (this study). Using this model, N-CEA residue positions were chosen for mutation to cysteine and subsequent coupling to either a paramagnetic or diamagnetic label. NMR PRE data were recorded for each mutant separately, yielding a total of 46 resonances demonstrating significant paramagnetic effects in AfaE-dsc. PRE effects were introduced into the structure calculation as distance restraints with +/- 4 Aa error. To check for non-specific binding effects, a control mutant (V20C) was chosen that was located over 25 Aa from the predicted binding surface. No paramagnetic effects were observed in the V20C complex. Interestingly, a further mutant, L95C, displayed severely reduced affinity for N-CEA (Table II) and yielded a complex undergoing exchange in the fast limit. Distances from this mutant were not included in the structure calculation as this residue was presumed to form part of the interaction surface of CEA, but it served to support the resulting structural ensemble.
