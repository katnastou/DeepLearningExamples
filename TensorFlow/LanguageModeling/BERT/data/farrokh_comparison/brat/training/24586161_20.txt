To gain insight to the specificity of acetyltransferases in the YopJ effector family, we determined if HopZ1a could acetylate AvrBsT's substrate ACIP1. Conversely, we determined if AvrBsT could acetylate HopZ1a's substrate tubulin. Incubation of GST-HopZ1a with GST-ACIP1 did not result in detectable acetylation of ACIP1 (Figure 2C). Moreover, neither HopZ1a nor other members of the HopZ family could physically associate with ACIP1 in targeted yeast two-hybrid screens (Figure S5A, B). Similarly, we could not detect AvrBsT-dependent acetylation of tubulin in vitro (Figure S5C) or direct physical interaction between AvrBsT and tubulin in yeast (Figure S5A,B). These data suggest that AvrBsT and HopZ1a possess distinct substrate specificity.
