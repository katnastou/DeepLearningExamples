Several studies have shown that ET-1-injection induced hypoxia to the optic nerve, astrogliosis and axonal loss. Therefore, the effect of intravitreal injection of ET-1 on AQP4 expression in retina was tested. As shown in Figure 2A, ET-1 injection resulted in a decrease in AQP4 mRNA as determined by Q-PCR. Five out of 7 rats (71%) showed a significant reduction in mRNA (54+/-11%, p<0.001 versus HEPES-injected or control, Figure 2A), and there was a similar reduction in AQP4 mRNA upon elevation of IOP in six out nine rats (67%, 62+/-12, p=0.001, Figure 2B). A similar reduction was observed in AQP4 protein levels in ET-1 injected and IOP-elevated eyes. As shown in Figure 3A, nine out of 11 rats (82%, Figure 3A) showed a decrease in AQP4 protein levels in ET-1 injected eyes (70+/-10%, p<0.05) and AQP4 protein levels decreased in five out seven rats following elevation of IOP (71%; 72+/-12% p<0.001, 3C).
