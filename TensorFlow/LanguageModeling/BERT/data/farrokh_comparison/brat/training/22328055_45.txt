Here, we show that OS9 interacts with both BRI1-5 and BRI1-9, but kifunensine treatment disturbed the association with BRI1-5 much more than with BRI1-9. The two distinct mutations affect very different regions of BRI1 (Hothorn et al.; She et al.) and genetic as well as biochemical studies have shown that the two mutated BRI1 forms have different requirements for ER quality control (Jin et al.; Hong et al.). Consequently our data argue that BRI1-5 and BRI1-9 represent different classes of ERAD substrates that require distinct components for degradation like it has also been proposed for mammalian ERAD substrates (Bernasconi et al.). The interaction of BRI1-9 with OS9 might be more dependent on interaction with exposed protein segments and OS9 may--like YOS9--also bind and assist in degradation of certain non-glycosylated substrates (Bhamidipati et al.; Jaenicke et al.).
