We report here the identification of CDC37 as a multicopy suppressor of the mps1-1 temperature-sensitive (ts) phenotype. In addition to multicopy suppressor interactions, we find that alleles of CDC37 and MPS1 exhibit synthetic lethal interactions. CDC37 was originally isolated by Reed (1980a) in a screen for mutations that cause cell cycle arrest at Start in G1 in a matingcompetent state, and a weak karyogamy defect is also seen in cdc37 mutants at the nonpermissive temperature. Functional homologues of this gene have recently been identified in Drosphilia melanogaster and mammals, and the mammalian gene encodes a subunit of the Hsp90 chaperone complex found in association with several protein kinases. Phenotypic analysis demonstrates that cdc37-1 arrest is a novel Start arrest, where the SPBs have begun duplication and formed an aberrant side-by-side structure, although the cell remains mating pheromone responsive. One SPB, apparently the newly formed one, displays an outer plaque defect. Mutation of CDC37 causes a loss of Mps1p kinase activity but does not affect protein stability. These findings demonstrate a requirement for CDC37 function in normal SPB duplication and may also suggest a more general role for this gene in G1 control.
