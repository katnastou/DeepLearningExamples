The involvement of RPD3-type HDAs, HDA6 and HDA19, in ABA and abiotic stress has been reported. It was found that hda6 mutant and HDA6 RNA-interference (HDA6-RNAi) plants displayed a phenotype that is more sensitive to ABA and salt stress. Compared with wild-type plants, the expression of ABA and abiotic stress-responsive genes was decreased in hda6 and HDA6-RNAi plants. Similarly, the Arabidopsis HDA19 T-DNA insertion mutant, hda19-1, was hypersensitive to ABA and salt stress, and the expression of ABA-responsive genes was decreased in hda19-1 plants. Arabidopsis HDA19 may act in a protein complex of AtERF7, a transcription repressor, to regulate the abiotic stress response genes. Furthermore, AtERF7 interacts with the Arabidopsis homologue of a human global corepressor of transcription, AtSin3, which, in turn, may interact with HDA19. It was proposed that AtERF7, AtSin3, and HDA19 can form a transcriptional repressor complex to regulate ABA and drought response in Arabidopsis.
