a, b Expression of PIWIL2 and HDAC3 in tumor and adjacent normal tissues from 30 pairs of cervical cancer patients were examined. The magnification is x400. *P < 0.05 and **P < 0.01. c PIWIL2 up-regulates HDAC3 expression at protein level in Hela cells and HepG2 cells. d Knockdown of PIWIL2 specifically decreases expression of only HDAC3 among class I HDACs. e Immunofluorescent staining of HDAC3 in PIWIL2 shRNA transfected Hela and HepG2 cells. f PIWIL2 has no effect on HDAC3 mRNA expression (N.S., not significant, P > 0.05). g The degradation of HDAC3 is faster in cells transfected with PIWIL2 shRNA than in cells transfected with control plasmid. Cells transfected with shPIWIL2 or shNC were treated with cycloheximide (CHX) at 50 muM for indicated time
