(A) Schematic of Fun30 protein. The CUE motif and ATPase domain are indicated. (B) The CUE motif of Fun30 is not required for genotoxin resistance. Growth phenotypes of strains 89 through 93 on indicated media are shown. Note pRS414-FUN30-CUE** encodes a Fun30 mutant with F82 and P83 in the CUE motif replaced by alanines. (C) The CUE motif restricts Fun30's ability to negatively regulate MMS-tolerance. Shown are growth phenotypes of strains 94 through 98 on indicated media.
