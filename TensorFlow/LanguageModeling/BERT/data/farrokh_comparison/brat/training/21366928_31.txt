Joppich et al. have reported that similar to LHR, HP4 (Hip) binds to HP1 and HP6 (Umbrea) in vitro, and that these proteins colocalize at pericentric heterochromatin and form a complex in vivo. These authors further proposed that the association between HP1 and HP6 is mediated by heterodimerization of the chromo-shadow domain (CSD) in each protein, similar to the known homodimerization of the CSD in HP1. Structural investigation suggests that CSD dimerization results in formation of a protein-protein interaction pit that is predicted to bind one peptide per CSD dimer. LHR, HP4, and HP5 each interact with both HP1 and HP6, but do not interact with each other. These interaction results combined with the limitation of CSD dimers to only bind one peptide, suggest that LHR, HP4 and HP5 are unlikely to simultaneously bind to HP1 or HP6 CSD dimers or to HP1/HP6 heterodimers. Instead, LHR, HP4, and HP5 likely interact separately with HP1 in distinct complexes.
