Garcia-Corzo and co-workers generated a Coq9 knockin mouse model by introducing the Coq9-R239X mutation that recapitulates the Arg244Ter human COQ9 mutation (Garcia-Corzo et al.,). The Coq9R239X/R239X homozygous knockin mice showed histologic and behavioral signs that mirrored mitochondrial encephalomyopathy associated with primary Q deficiency in human patients. A widespread Q deficiency was noted in these mice along with a dramatic reduction in the steady state level of the COQ7 polypeptide and accumulation of demethoxy-Q9 (DMQ9) (Garcia-Corzo et al.,). A second Coq9 mouse model (Coq9Q95X) also demonstrated that COQ9 is required for Q biosynthesis (Luna-Sanchez et al.,). However, the Q deficiency in the Coq9Q95X/Q95X mice is less severe than in the Coq9R239X/R239X mice, probably due to differences in nonsense-mediated decay efficiency and in the stability of the CoQ synthome (Luna-Sanchez et al.,).
