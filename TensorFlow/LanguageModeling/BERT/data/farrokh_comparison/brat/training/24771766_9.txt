Yeast cells expressing tetracystein-tagged Gln1 were incubated over night with FIAsH-EDT2 to label Gln1. The cells were washed twice with water and resuspended in a phosphate-citrate buffer to induce starvation (pH 6). Images were taken 4 hr after onset of starvation. White lines denote the cell boundaries. The scale bar is 5 mum.
