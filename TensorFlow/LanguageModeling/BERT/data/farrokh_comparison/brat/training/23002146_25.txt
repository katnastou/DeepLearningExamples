The C-terminal TGS domain (294-369) has predominantly beta sheet structure with five beta strands (beta12-beta16) and two helices, alpha10 and alpha11 (Figure 1). Superimposition of the Rbg1 TGS domain with the previously reported NMR solution structure of human Drg1 TGS domain (PDB ID 2EKI) gave an RMSD of 1.31 Aa over 76 Calpha atoms. The TGS domain was found to be structurally very similar to threonyl tRNA synthetase, YchF and hOLA1 TGS domains and ubiquitin.
