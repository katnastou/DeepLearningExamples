Plasmid for bacterial expression of recombinant His-Tda2 was created by PCR amplification of full-length ORF TDA2 from S. cerevisiae genomic DNA and was cloned into pET30a(+) using NdeI and SalI restriction sites. The 6-histidine tag was encoded in the forward primer used in the PCR so that the protein contained the sequence MHHHHHH directly attached to the amino terminus of Tda2. Plasmid for bacterial expression of recombinant GST-Aim21 was created by PCR amplification of full-length ORF AIM21 from S. cerevisiae genomic DNA and cloned in-frame into pGEX-5X-1 using EcoRI and SalI sites. Bicistronic plasmid for simultaneous expression in bacteria and of both yeast actin-capping protein subunits was created by PCR amplification of full-length ORF CAP1 and CAP2 from S. cerevisiae genomic DNA and cloned into pETDuet using restriction sites EcoRI and SalI for CAP1 (multiple cloning site I) and FseI and XhoI for CAP2 (multiple cloning site II). The pETDuet plasmid encodes for a 6-histidine tag attached to Cap1 for protein purification. The R15A and Y80A point mutations were introduced in CAP2 using the In-Fusion system (Takara Bio Inc.).
