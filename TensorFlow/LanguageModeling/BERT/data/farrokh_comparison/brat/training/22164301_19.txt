Nucleotide-sensing TLRs are divided into two groups based on their distribution profiles in DCs. In humans, TLR3 and TLR8 are expressed in myeloid DCs, while TLR7 and TLR9 are expressed in plasmacytoid DCs. Although TLR8 belongs to the TLR7/8/9 subfamily, the present study demonstrated that TLR8 possesses properties distinct from those of TLR7 and TLR9. First, TLR8, like TLR3, is localized to the early endosome but not in the late endosome/lysosome, where TLR7 and TLR9 reside. Second, although TLR8 requires UNC93B1 to exit from the ER, the TIR domain determines the endosomal targeting of TLR8.
