Identification of Atg1 double-aspartate mutant that binds Atg13 with wild-type affinity. (A) Structure of K. marxianus Atg1 EAT domain and Atg13 interaction showing mutated residues. Atg1 EAT domain: gray; Atg13: blue; mutants that decreased binding to Atg13 (L671, M681): green; mutants that retained wild-type binding to Atg13 (M765, M816): red. (B) Representative ITC thermograms showing binding affinity of Atg1 mutants with Atg13.
