A recent structural study of mCSF-1 in complex with the first three extracellular domains of mCSF-1R (mCSF-1RD1-D3) revealed unexpected monovalent binding of mCSF-1 to one mCSF-1RD1-D3 molecule leading to a binary complex, in contrast to predictions based on earlier studies of the homologous murine and human c-kit receptors in complex with Stem Cell Factor (SCF). While this first structural snapshot of a partial mCSF-1R complex is informative in its own right, it cannot be readily extrapolated to represent CSF-1R activation in general, given the complexity of species cross-reactivity in CSF-1R signaling. Furthermore, the reported binary mCSF-1RD1-D3:mCSF-1 complex does not offer realistic insights into possible homotypic receptor interactions, a likely critical element of receptor activation.
