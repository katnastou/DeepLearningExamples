To probe further whether up-regulation of mitochondrial respiration in puf3Delta strains was independent of mitochondrial biogenesis pathways, we over-expressed Hap4p, a known transcriptional regulator of mitochondrial biogenesis, and Gsm1p, another transcription factor implicated in regulating the expression of OXPHOS proteins, in wild-type and puf3Delta strains. Simultaneous over-expression of these two transcription factors caused similar increases in respiration in both wild-type and puf3Delta strains (Figure 2A) and, further increases in the already heightened steady-state levels of Cox2p and Cox4p in the puf3Delta strain (Figure 2B). Finally, we assayed the steady-state levels of COX17 transcripts, a canonical Puf3 target, and two non-P3E-target transcripts, RIP1 and COX12, by quantitative real-time RT-PCR. As expected, deletion of PUF3 leads to a dramatic increase in COX17 transcripts, but had little or no effect on the non-P3E targets, while over-expression of HAP4 and GSM1 in a wild-type strain led to an increase in COX12 and RIP1 mRNA (Figure 2C). Importantly, Hap4p/Gsm1p over-expression increased all of these transcripts to a similar degree in the puf3Delta strain (Figure 2C), bolstering our conclusion that up-regulation of respiration in the absence of Puf3p is largely independent of pathways that increase mitochondrial biogenesis.
