The above results suggest that the action of a Eps15-Hrb complex must somehow be exerted at the cytosolic level. In search of a possible mechanism, we measured the steady state levels of Rev in the presence of Eps15 alone or in combination with Hrb/Hrbl. Transfection of Eps15 or Hrb or Hrbl, together with Rev, caused a modest increase in the steady state levels of Rev (Fig. 4 C). However, when Rev was cotransfected with Eps15 with either Hrb or Hrbl, a four- to sixfold increase in Rev levels was detected (Fig. 4 C). These differences were not due to variable transfection efficiency, since all cellular lysates displayed the same amount of beta-galactosidase activity, which was expressed by the cotransfected plasmid pCMVbeta-gal (see Materials and Methods), and used as an internal standard.
