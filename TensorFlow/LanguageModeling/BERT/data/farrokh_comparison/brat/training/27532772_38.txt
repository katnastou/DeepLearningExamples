Chemical shift perturbation and line broadening analyses were performed by comparing the 1H-15N HSQC spectrum of chemically reconstituted 15N-labeled BOLA3-GLRX5 with that of BOLA3. The residues of the loop containing the conserved Cys59 of BOLA3 showed strong chemical shift changes only in the holo hetero-complex relative to the apoform (Figure 6B,D and Figure 6--figure supplement 1, right parts). A similar comparison for the 15N-labeled BOLA1-GLRX5 complex showed that the region around His67 of BOLA1 (structurally close to Cys59 of BOLA3) exhibited similar chemical shift changes, even though fewer residues were affected in BOLA1 (Figure 6A,C, and Figure 6--figure supplement 1, left parts). The chemical shift perturbation analysis for 15N-labeled GLRX5 revealed that the residues of GLRX5 involved in the apo interaction are also affected in the holo-complex and that the conserved Cys67 of GLRX5 was additionally altered in the holo complexes only (Figure 6--figure supplement 2). In addition, two other adjacent GLRX5 residues (Lys59 for BOLA3 and Gly60 for BOLA1 interaction) were altered that are part of the GSH binding site. The regions of GLRX5 affected by the interaction with BOLA1 and BOLA3 are essentially the same as those in the [2Fe-2S]2+ GLRX5 homodimer. This indicates that, for GLRX5, the same interaction regions are involved in both homo- and hetero-dimer formation, and the same groups (the conserved Cys67 and GSH) can act as iron ligands of the [2Fe-2S]2+ cluster.
