The SAXS measurements were carried out using an Anton Paar SAXSess camera equipped with a PANalytical PW3830 X-ray generator and a Princeton CCD detector. The beam length was set to 18 mm and the beam profile was recorded using an image plate for subsequent desmearing. Data for the IscS-IscU complex were collected at 4degreesC with protein concentrations of 4.5 mg/ml (10 h), 10 mg/ml (2 h), and 21 mg/ml (2 h). For the IscS-TusA complex, a data set was recorded at 4degreesC for 30 min at 22 mg/ml. Dark current correction, scaling, buffer subtraction, and desmearing were performed using the Anton Paar software SAXSquant 3.0. Data sets recorded at different concentrations for IscS-IscU were merged in Primus after removal of the lowest resolution shell (0.012-0.12 Aa-1) for the 10 and 21 mg/ml data sets, for which Guinier plots showed larger Rg values (~39 Aa) indicating concentration-dependent oligomerization. The data sets were binned (5:1) in the range of 0.012-0.35 Aa-1 and fitted directly against predicted scattering calculated from atomic coordinates using the program CRYSOL (http://www.embl-hamburg.de/ExternalInfo/Research/Sax/crysol.html). Experimental Rg values were estimated from Guinier plots, while calculated Rg values were determined using CRYSOL.
