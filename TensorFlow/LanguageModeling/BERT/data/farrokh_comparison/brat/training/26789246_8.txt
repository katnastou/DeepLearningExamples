No density was observed for the N-terminal TMD0 domain of both TAP1 and TAP2 subunits (Fig 2). Studies have shown that the TMD0s are essential to the assembly of the large peptide-loading complex but dispensable in peptide translocation. ICP47 inhibits both full-length TAP and the core construct. Our results indicate that in the absence of tapasin the two TMD0s are flexibly tethered to the core region of TAP.
