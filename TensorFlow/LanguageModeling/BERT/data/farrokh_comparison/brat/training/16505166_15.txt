To elucidate the mechanism by which Vta1 impacts Vps4 function, biochemical characterization of Vta1 was initiated. Consistent with published data, we found that both Vta1 from yeast cell extract and bacterially expressed Vta1 elute from a gel filtration column in the range of 300 kD, in spite of a predicted molecular mass of ~40 kD (Fig. 3 A). Together, these observations suggest that Vta1 forms a homomeric complex. The subtle difference in size observed between bacterially produced Vta1 and yeast Vta1 may be due to the sizes of the epitopes used in each case (His6 for bacteria vs. 3x HA for yeast); alternatively, Vta1 homooligomers may be associated with other factors in yeast extracts.
