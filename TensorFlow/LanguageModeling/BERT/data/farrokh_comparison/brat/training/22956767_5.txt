Small-subunit (40S) 18S rRNA in Saccharomyces cerevisiae contains only three base methylations. Two of these, at positions A1781 and A1782, are catalyzed by Dim1. Dim1 is essential for viability, but the methylations catalyzed by it are not. The third base methylation, at position G1575, is catalyzed by Bud23. The methylated guanosine is located in the P-site of the small subunit, and its methylation is conserved throughout eukaryotes. However, similar to Dim1 and despite its seemingly important location, methylation of G1575 is also not essential. Large-subunit (60S) 25S rRNA contains at least six base methylations, but none of the methyltransferases responsible for these modifications has been characterized.
