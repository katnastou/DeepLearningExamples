We identified 16 in vivo phosphorylation sites on Cdr2 as part of a large-scale SILAC-based phosphoproteomic screen for substrates of Pom1 (Figures 1A and Table S1). Briefly, Pom1 kinase activity was inhibited for 15 minutes using an analog-sensitive pom1-as strain. Changes in the phosphoproteome were quantified using phosphopeptide enrichment followed by nanoscale microcapillary LC-MS/MS as previously described (see Experimental Procedures, the full results of this screen will be published as a separate study). The C-terminal tail domain (CTD) of Cdr2 was phosphorylated in a manner that heavily depended on Pom1, suggesting that this cluster of serine residues is the primary site of Pom1-dependent regulation in cells. Consistent with this possibility, purified Pom1 phosphorylated the Cdr2-CTD directly in vitro (Figure S1A). In contrast, we found a single residue (Thr166) in the Cdr2 kinase domain that was more heavily phosphorylated upon inhibition of Pom1 (Table S1). This suggests that Thr166 is modified by a different kinase, and may be antagonized by Pom1. Thr166 was the only phosphorylation site that we found in the Cdr2 kinase domain, and represents a well-conserved feature of the activation loop (T-loop) among AMPK/SNF1-related kinases from yeast through humans (Figure 1B). This T-loop Thr is present in three additional fission yeast members of the AMPK/SNF1 protein kinase family, but not in the Cdr2-related protein kinase Cdr1. T-loop phosphorylation by upstream kinases is required for the catalytic activity of members of this protein kinase family. Therefore, we decided to investigate the role of Cdr2-T166 phosphorylation in cells.
