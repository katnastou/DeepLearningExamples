To further prove that HES1 negatively regulates DTX1 expression, we made a dominant negative human HES1 (dnHES1) by mutating three amino acids critical for DNA binding while leaving dimerization motifs intact. HES1 binds to and inhibits the activity of its own promoter, which can be shown with reporter construct HES1-AB. In 293T cells, expression of HES1 suppressed HES1-AB promoter activity, but adding dnHES1 reversed HES1-mediated inhibition of Hes1-AB (Figure 4A). Similar results were found in OS187 cells (data not shown), confirming that dnHES1 blocks HES1 function. Then, we tested whether dnHES1 could block HES1-mediated inhibition of DTX1 transcription in osteosarcoma. Transduction with dnHES1 upregulated DTX1 transcription in three osteosarcoma cell lines (Figure 4B), indicating that HES1 suppressed DTX1 expression in osteosarcoma. Expression of HASH1, a known HES1 target, also was upregulated by dnHES1 (Figure 4B and 4C) in parallel with DTX1.
