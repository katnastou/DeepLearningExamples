Analysis by electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA) demonstrated that HR1 as well as TR2 possess high dsRNA binding affinity, which is greatly reduced in HR2. Consistent with the EMSA results, domain swapping experiments showed that TR2 is capable of replacing HR1 both in vitro and in vivo: TR2+HR2 chimeric protein has similar pri-miRNA binding affinity in vitro compared with HR1+2 and the TR2+HR2 chimeric protein is able to rescue the hyl1-2 mutant phenotype in vivo. Notably, from the crystal structure we found HR2 harbors a putative dimerization interface. The dimerization of HYL1 was further confirmed by in vitro pull-down, coimmunoprecipitation, and analytical gel filtration assays.
