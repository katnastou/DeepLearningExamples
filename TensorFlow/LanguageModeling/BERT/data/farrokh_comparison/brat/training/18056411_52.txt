Flag-tagged IFNAR1 proteins (wild type or KR mutant) were expressed in 293T cells and purified using M2 agarose (Sigma-Aldrich) followed by sequential stringent washes with buffers containing 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 M NaCl, and 0.1% SDS. Subsequent washes were performed with the same buffer containing 200 mM NaCl, 100 mM NaCl, and, finally, TBS. These washes were stringent enough to remove any detectable Tyk2 from immunoprecipitated IFNAR1. The precipitated proteins were eluted with 0.1 M glycine, pH 3.0 and resolved by SDS-PAGE. Approximately 1% of the eluate was analyzed by immunoblotting with antiubiquitin antibody (FK2; BIOMOL International, L.P.) to determine the apparent molecular weight of ubiquitinated receptor and anti-FLAG M2 antibody. 80% of eluate was analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by colloidal Coomassie (Invitrogen) staining.
