It is anticipated that additional genes and/or mechanisms may be involved in the regulation of Rnr activities. To investigate this possibility, we utilized the powerful budding yeast genetic system to identify such genes, and report here the identification of a novel gene, CRT10, whose mutation enhances hydroxyurea (HU) resistance. Genetic characterization indicates that CRT10 is involved in the transcriptional regulation of RNR genes.
