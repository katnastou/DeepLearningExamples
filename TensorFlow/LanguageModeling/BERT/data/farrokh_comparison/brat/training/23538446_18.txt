To understand the physiological role of RASSF5 downregulation by Itch during cell cycle progression, RASSF5A was coexpressed with either Itchwt or ItchC830A in HEK293T cells. As shown in Figure 6A, transient overexpression of Itchwt but not ItchC830A significantly suppresses RASSF5A-mediated G1 arrest. However, the profile of S and G2/M phases of the cell cycle was not significantly altered when RASSF5A coexpressed with Itch (Supplementary Figures S8A, B and C). Furthermore, C646-promoted G1 arrest was downregulated by Itch overexpression (Supplementary Figures S9A and B). The patterns of G1 arrest inversely correlated with the acetylation status of RASSF5 (Figure 5a), suggesting that acetylation modulates RASSF5 function during cell cycle. Interestingly, RASSF5-mediated apoptosis was impaired by Itchwt but not ItchC830A (Figure 6b). The specificity of regulation was further confirmed by the fact that Itch failed to alter the G1 cell cycle pattern as well as apoptosis when it is overexpressed with RASSF5AY24A (defective for Itch interaction)(Figures 6a and b). These data indicate that the association of RASSF5 with Itch, or additional PPxY-dependent protein interaction, may be required to elicit apoptosis (Figure 6b). This later fact is a likely reason behind the inconsistency between RASSF5A expression in tumor cells and its role as a tumor suppressor, as high levels may indicate enhance protein acetylation and inactivation of the ability to promote apoptosis of tumor cells.
