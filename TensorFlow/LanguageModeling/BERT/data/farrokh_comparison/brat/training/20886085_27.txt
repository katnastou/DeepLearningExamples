At Pol II promoters, RSC activity generally involves single nucleosome events that help to form and maintain the NFR. These data were generated from studies using a temperature sensitive mutant of the Sth1 catalytic subunit, which is common to both the RSC1 and RSC2 complexes. We found that only the RSC1 complex affects genome-wide 5' acetylated H4 levels, and that the small STE11 cryptic transcript is sensitive to RSC1 deletion. It is possible that in the absence of the RSC1 complex, certain promoters are not able to maintain an NFR and therefore have greater histone density at the promoter region. Future studies could examine the role of RSC1 complex versus RSC2 complex in the establishment and maintenance of Pol II promoter NFRs.
