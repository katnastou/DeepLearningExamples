Interestingly a different Rac GEF, Kalirin, has been reported to promote ARF6-dependent Rac activation downstream of EFA6, another ARF6-GEF. Therefore different ARF-GEFs might not only regulate ARFs at different subcellular locations, they might also couple ARF to different signaling pathways to achieve similar outputs. Clearly much work remains to delineate signaling networks involving ARF6.
