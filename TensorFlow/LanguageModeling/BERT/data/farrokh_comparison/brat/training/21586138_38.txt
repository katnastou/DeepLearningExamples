DU145, PC-3 and PPC-1 cells were seeded into 6-well tissue culture plates. Cells were transfected with non-targeting siRNA or siRNA specific for Siah2 or POSH. 48 hours after siRNA transfection, RNA was harvested using the RNeasy kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). cDNA was generated using SuperScript II Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen). qRT-PCR was carried out using primer sets for 18S, Siah2 or POSH in the presence of FastStart Universal SYBR Green Master Mix (Roche, Nutley, NJ). PCR was performed and analyzed using a 4300 Real Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Percent mRNA remaining was determined by the comparative CT method (DeltaCT) for relative quantification.
