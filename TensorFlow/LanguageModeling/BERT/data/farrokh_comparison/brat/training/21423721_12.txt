To confirm the frequent bipolar attachment of sister chromatids in achiasmate cells, we depleted Sgo1, which inhibits the removal of centromeric cohesin during anaphase I. We hypothesized that although sister chromatids are frequently attached to both poles and are pulled from opposite directions, the centromere cohesion that persists until meiosis II should provide resistance against this force and prevent their separation during anaphase I in achiasmate cells. If so, depletion of Sgo1, which eliminates centromere cohesion during anaphase I, should lead to frequent equational segregation of sister chromatids.
