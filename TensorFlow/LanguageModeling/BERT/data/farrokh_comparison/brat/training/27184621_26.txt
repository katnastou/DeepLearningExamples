All cell lines were provided by the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center at Dallas with the approval of IRB. Patient-derived GBM (Ink-/-, CD133+, EGFRvIII) and Neuroblastoma (SH-SY5Y cell line human) were used as two primary cancer models. Different genetically modified cells, including two human brain tumor cell lines (D54, human astrocytoma cell line derived from a patient with glioblastoma multiforme (grade IV) and D54-EGFRvIII) and four different gene-altered mouse astrocytes mimicking different levels of human cancerous cells (p53-/-, p53-/- PTEN-/-, p53-/- Braf, and p53-/- PTEN-/- Braf astrocytes) were used. These four types of mouse astrocytes were derived from the same wild-type mouse astrocytes.
