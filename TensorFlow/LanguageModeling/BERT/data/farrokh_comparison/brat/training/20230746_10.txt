As the first step in exploring the mechanism of Ams2 proteolysis, we examined the role of the proteasome pathway in this process. In fission yeast, the mts2+ and mts3+ gene products have been identified as subunits of the 26S proteasome. We used temperature-sensitive mutations mts2-1 and mts3-1 to inactivate proteasome function. Mutant cells carrying pREP41-Ams2 were cultured at the restrictive temperature (36degreesC) for 3 hr and Ams2 synthesis was repressed by addition of thiamine and CHX as described above (Figure 2A). Whereas Ams2 underwent rapid proteolysis in wild-type cells (Figures 2A and 2B, open circles), degradation of Ams2 was markedly decreased in arrested mts2-1 (filled circles) and mts3-1 (data not shown) cells. These observations indicated that Ams2 proteolysis requires the proteasome-dependent pathway.
