Hyou1 heterozygosity aggravates ER stress in Sil1-/- Purkinje cells. BiP upregulation in lobule II (A-D) or lobule X (E-H) of cerebella from 6-week-old Sil1-/- (A, B, E, F) and Sil1-/-; Hyou1+/- mice (C, D, G, H). Sections were subjected to immunostaining with antibodies against BiP and calbindin-D28 (Calb). Camera exposure times are equal for images of the same channel. Scale bar = 100 microm.
