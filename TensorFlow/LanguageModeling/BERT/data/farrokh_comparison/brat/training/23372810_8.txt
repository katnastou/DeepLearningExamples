Est1p undergoes cell cycle-regulated degradation during G1 phase, thereby preventing Est3p recruitment and telomerase complex assembly. Here we present evidence that Est1 protein levels oscillate during the cell cycle through an APC-dependent mechanism in vivo. Degradation requires three sequences in Est1p that match the D-box consensus, consistent with direct recognition of Est1p by the APC. However, recombinant Est1 protein is not degraded or ubiquitinated by the APC in vitro, suggesting that Est1p either lacks the necessary structure or modification(s) that influence APC recognition in vivo or is an indirect target of the APC. Because Est1p stimulates association of Est3p with the telomerase complex, these results shed light on the regulation of yeast telomerase biogenesis and demonstrate an additional connection between telomere maintenance and cell cycle regulation pathways.
