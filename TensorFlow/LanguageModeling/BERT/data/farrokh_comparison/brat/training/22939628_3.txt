Intracellular calcium (Ca2+) homeostasis plays a crucial role in neuron survival and function. Neuronal Ca2+ influx is mediated through voltage-gated channels and/or receptor-operated channels activated by neurotransmitters. Intracellular Ca2+ release occurs via ryanodine receptors (RyRs) and inositol (1,4,5)-trisphosphate receptors (IP3Rs) on the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). There are three isoforms of RyR in the brain. RyR1 and RyR2 are both expressed in the hippocampus. RyR2 expression is up-regulated in rat hippocampus following intensive training tasks. RyR2 knock-down impairs performance of mice in passive avoidance tests whereas RyR1 knock-down did not.
