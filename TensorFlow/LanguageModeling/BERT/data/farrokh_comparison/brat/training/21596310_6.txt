Here we report the identification of a human complex comprising the MBT-domain containing protein L3MBTL2 along with well-characterized PcG proteins. We describe the multiple activities exhibited by this complex that promote repressive chromatin architecture. We also found that the methyl-lysine binding capability of L3MBTL2 was not required for its transcriptional repressor function, yet the ability of the complex to compact chromatin and independently mediate H2AK119ub1 was important for maintaining repression of target genes.
