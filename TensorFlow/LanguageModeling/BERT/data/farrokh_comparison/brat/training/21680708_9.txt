All GPI-anchored proteins seem to share two conserved motifs that could potentially function as a recognition motif for the p24 complex: the GPI anchor and a serine/threonine (S/T) region. The GPI-anchor is covalently attached to a newly generated COOH-terminal residue (omega site) after cleavage of the GPI-attachment signal in the ER. The S/T region upstream of the omega site is a site for O-mannosylation, which begins in the ER in yeast. To identify the region of GPI-anchored protein binding to Emp24p, we used three different mutant constructs of the Gas1p. In one construct Gas1p is devoid of its GPI anchor and instead contains an artificial transmembrane domain (TMD) consisting of 19 leucine residues and two flanking arginine and serine residues (Gas1TMD). In a second construct Gas1p is deleted of its S/T region [Gas1(-S/T)]. In the third construct Gas1p is mutated at the omega site to prevent GPI anchoring (Gas1Q). We observed that only wild-type Gas1p and Gas1(-S/T) can be cross-linked to Emp24p (Figure 1, D and E). Therefore these results show that Emp24p recognizes and binds to the GPI-anchored proteins via the GPI anchor prior to and/or during ER exit.
