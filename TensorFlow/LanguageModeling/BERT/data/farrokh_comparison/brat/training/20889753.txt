Translational defects in a mutant deficient in YajL, the bacterial homolog of the parkinsonism-associated protein DJ-1. 
We report here that YajL is associated with ribosomes and interacts with many ribosomal proteins and that a yajL mutant of Escherichia coli displays decreased translation accuracy, as well as increased dissociation of 70S ribosomes into 50S and 30S subunits after oxidative stress.
