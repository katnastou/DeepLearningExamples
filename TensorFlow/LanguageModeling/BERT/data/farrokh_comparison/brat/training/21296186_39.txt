Steady state levels of Coq9p mirrored those of Coq7p, and thus it is tempting to speculate that Coq8 may also phosphorylate Coq9p. In fact, Coq9p has been detected in a yeast phosphoproteome analysis and is phosphorylated at T34. Currently, this is the only reported phosphorylation site in any yeast Coq polypeptide. The amino terminal sequence of Coq9 residue is not conserved in metazoan Coq9 sequences, and it is interesting that T34 may be located within the predicted mitochondrial leader sequence of yeast Coq9p (Table 1S). Overexpression of COQ8 is known to suppress a nonsense (Q151STOP) coq9 mutant, and was attributed to a detectable presence of Coq9p due to read-through. Overexpression of COQ8 restores the steady state level of Coq4p in several coq null mutants, but not in the coq9 null mutant. While experiments have not revealed a complex between Coq8p and Coq9p, it is certainly possible that phosphorylation of Coq9p by Coq8p might be necessary to form a Q biosynthetic complex and so preserve the otherwise unstable Coq polypeptides known to interact with Coq9, including Coq4p, Coq6p, and Coq7p. It is likely that such Coq8-mediated phosphorylation of Coq polypeptides might function to regulate Q6 synthesis, and thus also account for the COQ8 multicopy suppression of the coq10 mutant.
