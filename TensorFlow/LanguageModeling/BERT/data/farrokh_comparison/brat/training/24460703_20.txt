Mid2 cytoplasmic tail interacts directly with the Apm4 mu homology region. A) GST alone; GST tagged wild type Apm4 and GST tagged Apm4 mutants were prepared as described and incubated with His-tagged cytoplasmic tail of Mid2. Their binding interaction was tested using pull down assays on beads at two different concentrations of Mid2. Mid2 binding was detected using anti-His tag antibodies after western blotting. Input lane is 35 microm Mid2. B) Mid2-GFP was transformed into cells expressing wild type, mutant or no Apm4. Localization to the bud neck following 150 microg/mL CF was analysed. Scale bar = 5 microm.
