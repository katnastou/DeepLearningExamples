We analyzed the MUC5AC expression in lung cancer patient tissues. Clinical information was available on 21 patients with a median age at diagnosis of 63 years (range: 44-79 years). Survival information was available on 20 patients. Patients without MUC5AC expression in their tumor cells had a longer survival compared with MUC5AC expressing tumors (P = 0.029). Five-year overall survival for MUC5AC-negative patients was 93% (95% confidence interval, 59-99%) compared with 67% in the MUC5AC expressing patients (95% confidence interval, 19-90%) (Figure 2a), indicating that MUC5AC is a prognostic marker for worse outcomes in lung cancer.
