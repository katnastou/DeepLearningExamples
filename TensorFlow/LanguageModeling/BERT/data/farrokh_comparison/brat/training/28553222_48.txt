Arc has predicted consensus SUMOylation sites at lysine 110 and lysine 286 (Bramham et al.,), and mutation of these sites blocks in vitro Arc SUMOylation in HEK cells (Craig et al.,). In cultured hippocampal neurons, viral overexpression of the Arc-KK SUMO mutant, but not wild-type Arc, prevents tetrodotoxin-induced synaptic scaling, indicating that Arc SUMOylation may be required for homeostatic scaling of AMPARs (Craig et al.,). Overexpression of Arc-KK does not affect GluA1 endocytosis, suggesting that Arc SUMOylation promotes the forward trafficking of GluA1 to the cell surface and thus favors homeostatic potentiation of synapses during chronic acitivity blockade (Craig and Henley,; Craig et al.,). It is further noteworthy that drebrin A, which we have shown interacts with SUMOylated Arc, is implicated in the activity-dependent membrane insertion of AMPARs (Kato et al.,).
