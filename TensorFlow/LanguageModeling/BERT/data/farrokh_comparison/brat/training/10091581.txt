The Schizosaccharomyces pombe Pzh1 protein phosphatase regulates Na+ ion influx in a Trk1-independent fashion. 
We have previously shown that fission yeast encodes a PPZ-like phosphatase, designated Pzhl, which is an important determinant of cation homeostasis. pzh1 delta mutants display increased tolerance to Na+ ions, but they are hypersensitive to KC1 [Balcells, L., Gomez, N., Casamayor, A., Clotet, J. & Arino, J. (1997) Eur. J. Biochem. 250, 476-483]. We have immunodetected Pzh1 in yeast extracts and found that this phosphatase is largely associated with particulate fractions. Cells defective in Pzh1 do not show altered efflux of Na+ or Li+ ions, but they accumulate these cations more slowly than wild-type cells. K+ ion content of pzh1 delta cells is about twice that of wild-type cells, and this can be explained by decreased efflux of K+. Therefore, Pzh1 may regulate both Na+ influx and K+ efflux in fission yeast. To test the possible relationship between K+ uptake, Na+ tolerance and Pzh1 function, we deleted the trk1+ gene, which encodes a putative high-affinity transporter of K+ ions. trkl delta mutants grew well even at relatively low concentrations of KCl and did not show significantly altered content or influx of K+ ions. However, they showed a Na(+)-sensitive phenotype which was greatly intensified by deletion of the sod2+ gene (which encodes the major determinant for efflux of Na+ ions), and clearly ameliorated by deletion of the pzh1 phosphatase, as well as by moderate concentrations of KCl in the medium. These results suggest that Trk1 does not mediate the effect of Pzh1 on NaCl tolerance and that fission yeast contains efficient systems, other than Trk1, for uptake of K+ ions.
