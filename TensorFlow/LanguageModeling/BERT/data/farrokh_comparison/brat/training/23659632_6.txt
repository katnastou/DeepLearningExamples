Aprataxin possesses both a zinc finger domain and a forkhead-associated domain (major splice variant only) in addition to the HIT domain. An enzyme that is specific to the nucleus and nucleolus, Aprataxin hydrolyzes both dinucleotide polyphosphates and phophoramidates, and may play a role in repairing 5' AMP overhangs resulting from the repair of single-strand DNA breaks by DNA ligase. Mutations in the Aprataxin-encoding gene (APTX) cause ataxia oculomotor apraxia-1, a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the inability to control eye and other facial musculature.
