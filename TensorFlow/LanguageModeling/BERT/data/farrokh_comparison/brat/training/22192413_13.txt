Next, we examined expression of Nkx2.5 and Tbx5 in E9 UTX-null and control littermate embryos using whole mount in situ hybridization analyses. Nkx2.5 and Tbx5 were highly expressed in the sinoatrial structures and heart tube of UTXDelta/Delta embryos, but the overall levels were reduced compared to those in UTXDelta/+ littermates (Fig. 3I-P), suggesting that UTX plays a role in maintaining high levels of Nkx2.5 and Tbx5 in the developing heart. To monitor the expression of heart-specific genes that are regulated by the core cardiac transcription factors, we performed whole mount in situ hybridization analyses in littermate embryos. ANF, an atrial natriuretic peptide, is a marker of the differentiating chamber myocardium. SRF, Tbx5, Nkx2.5 and GATA4, alone or in combination, bind to their cognate sites in the ANF enhancer and activate its transcription. In addition, Nkx2.5 and Tbx5 also activate expression of the ventricle-specific contractile protein MLC2v. Whole mount in situ hybridization revealed that ANF expression was greatly reduced in UTXDelta/Delta embryonic heart (Fig. 3Q-T). In addition, MLC2v was also substantially decreased and the expression pattern of MLC2v was severely altered in UTXDelta/Delta embryos (Fig. 3U-Z). Together, our data establish that UTX plays a crucial role in maintaining high levels of Nxk2.5 and Tbx5 expression and marked upregulation of heart-specific genes during embryonic development.
