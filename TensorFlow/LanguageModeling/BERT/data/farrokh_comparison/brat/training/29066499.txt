A mutually exclusive stem-loop arrangement in roX2 RNA is essential for X-chromosome regulation in Drosophila. 
The X chromosome provides an ideal model system to study the contribution of RNA-protein interactions in epigenetic regulation. In male flies, roX long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) harbor several redundant domains to interact with the ubiquitin ligase male-specific lethal 2 (MSL2) and the RNA helicase Maleless (MLE) for X-chromosomal regulation. However, how these interactions provide the mechanics of spreading remains unknown. By using the uvCLAP (UV cross-linking and affinity purification) methodology, which provides unprecedented information about RNA secondary structures in vivo, we identified the minimal functional unit of roX2 RNA. By using wild-type and various MLE mutant derivatives, including a catalytically inactive MLE derivative, MLEGET, we show that the minimal roX RNA contains two mutually exclusive stem-loops that exist in a peculiar structural arrangement: When one stem-loop is unwound by MLE, an alternate structure can form, likely trapping MLE in this perpetually structured region. We show that this functional unit is necessary for dosage compensation, as mutations that disrupt this formation lead to male lethality. Thus, we propose that roX2 lncRNA contains an MLE-dependent affinity switch to enable reversible interactions of the MSL complex to allow dosage compensation of the X chromosome.
