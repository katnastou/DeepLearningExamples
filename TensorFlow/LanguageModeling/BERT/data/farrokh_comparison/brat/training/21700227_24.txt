The increase in Pho2 and Pho4 binding after Pi starvation (recruitment) is calculated using the following equation: taking Pho4 as an example, EnrichmentNo/High = (Pho4ChIP No / Pho4Input No) / (Pho4ChIP High / Pho4Input High). To estimate a threshold to define transcription factor recruitment, we calculated the mean and standard deviation of Pho2 and Pho4 recruitment at all consensus 'CACGTG' sites, excluding the sites at regulatory regions of Pho4 regulated genes (functional binding sites). We used mean + 2 standard deviations (s.d.) as the threshold to identify the sites showing the most significant recruitment (Figure 4B). 23 of 28 sites showing recruitment of both Pho2 and Pho4 are regulated by both factors (p = 8.1 x 10-16, Fisher's exact test), and none of the Pho4-only recruited sites is regulated by Pho4 (p = 0.003, Fisher's exact test).
