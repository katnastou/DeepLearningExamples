A novel ER-microtubule-binding protein, ERLIN2, stabilizes Cyclin B1 and regulates cell cycle progression. 
The gene encoding endoplasmic reticulum (ER) lipid raft-associated protein 2 (ERLIN2) is amplified in human breast cancers. ERLIN2 gene mutations were also found to be associated with human childhood progressive motor neuron diseases. Yet, an understanding of the physiological function and mechanism for ERLIN2 remains elusive. In this study, we reveal that ERLIN2 is a spatially and temporally regulated ER-microtubule-binding protein that has an important role in cell cycle progression by interacting with and stabilizing the mitosis-promoting factors. Whereas ERLIN2 is highly expressed in aggressive human breast cancers, during normal development ERLIN2 is expressed at the postnatal stage and becomes undetectable in adulthood. ERLIN2 interacts with the microtubule component alpha-tubulin, and this interaction is maximal during the cell cycle G2/M phase where ERLIN2 simultaneously interacts with the mitosis-promoting complex Cyclin B1/Cdk1. ERLIN2 facilitates K63-linked ubiquitination and stabilization of Cyclin B1 protein in G2/M phase. Downregulation of ERLIN2 results in cell cycle arrest, represses breast cancer proliferation and malignancy and increases sensitivity of breast cancer cells to anticancer drugs. In summary, our study revealed a novel ER-microtubule-binding protein, ERLIN2, which interacts with and stabilizes mitosis-promoting factors to regulate cell cycle progression associated with human breast cancer malignancy.
