In budding yeast, mutational analyses have shown that all five KEOPS subunits contribute to telomere homeostasis and t6A formation. Of the five KEOPS subunits, Kae1 is the sole subunit universally conserved across all three domains of life. Hence, we reasoned that Kae1 contributed an essential core function within KEOPS and that Bud32, Cgi121, Pcc1 and Gon7 evolved to augment or regulate Kae1. Interestingly, eukaryotic cells harbor a Kae1 paralog, Qri7, which is targeted to mitochondria. Consistent with the predicted paralogous relationship, redirection of Qri7 from the mitochondria to the cytoplasm via deletion of the mitochondrial targeting sequence enabled rescue of the slow growth phenotype of a kae1Delta yeast strain. Intriguingly, GFP-tagged Bud32, Gon7, Cgi121 and Pcc1 proteins do not localize to the mitochondria and the yeast genome does not appear to encode mitochondria-targeted paralogues of Bud32, Gon7, Cgi121 and Pcc1. Taken together, these results raised the possibility that Qri7 and Kae1 share a common essential function, but that Qri7 operates in mitochondria in the absence of additional regulatory KEOPS subunits.
