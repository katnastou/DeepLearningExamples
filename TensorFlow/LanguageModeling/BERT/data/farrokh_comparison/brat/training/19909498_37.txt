In conclusion, as proof-of-concept, we show that an SDL screen offers an effective, complementary method to elucidating biological functions of proteolytic pathways. Dsk2 was first identified 11 years ago in a genetic screen for genes involved in SPB duplication. To our knowledge, the Spc98-induced toxicity in rad23 dsk2 mutant cells is the second piece of evidence linking Dsk2 and Rad23 to SPB duplication, which will help us to unravel the specific role of Rad23 and Dsk2 in this process. It is also conceivable that the SDL screen can be adapted to identify relevant ubiquitylation enzymes involved in substrate turnover. The creation of RNAi knock-down libraries and ORF overexpression collections would extend the use of SDL screens in the Ub/proteasome system to higher eukaryotes.
