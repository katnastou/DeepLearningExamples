The functional and physical relationships among these proteins, and the function of SM proteins in particular, have remained obscure despite extensive study. Vps33, the SM subunit of HOPS, has conserved grooves that bind the alpha-helical SNARE domains of R- and Qa-SNAREs in parallel and in register with respect to the arginyl and glutaminyl residues at the center of their SNARE domains, the 0-layer. This might represent an early step in the catalysis of trans-SNARE complex assembly. This idea was supported by functional studies in which SNARE complex assembly was inferred from assays of the consequent fusion. When R-SNARE proteoliposomes were incubated with proteoliposomes in which the three Q-SNAREs were preassembled, HOPS was needed only for its tethering function because HOPS with mutations in its SM subunit that blocked SNARE domain binding supported this fusion, and the nonspecific membrane clustering agent polyethylene glycol could substitute for HOPS. When the Q-SNAREs were not preassembled on the starting proteoliposomes and the fusion reaction depended on separate addition of the Qc-SNARE, these HOPS mutants still supported vesicle clustering but no longer supported fusion, and polyethylene glycol no longer sufficed. It was therefore suggested that HOPS may function beyond tethering when maximal SNARE complex assembly is required. To test this model, further direct assays of the amounts of newly assembled SNARE complex that form in the presence or absence of HOPS are required to establish whether HOPS suffices to mediate such assembly.
