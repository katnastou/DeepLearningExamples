Two genes for ribosomal protein 51 of Saccharomyces cerevisiae complement and contribute to the ribosomes. 
We cloned and sequenced the second gene coding for yeast ribosomal protein 51 (RP51B). When the DNA sequence of this gene was compared with the DNA sequence of RP51A (J.L. Teem and M. Rosbash, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 80:4403--4407, 1983), the following conclusions emerged: both genes code for a protein of 135 amino acids; both open reading frames are interrupted by a single intron which occurs directly after the initiating methionine; the open reading frames are 96% homologous and code for the same protein with the exception of the carboxy-terminal amino acid; DNA sequence homology outside of the coding region is extremely limited. The cloned genes, in combination with the one-step gene disruption techniques of Rothstein (R. J. Rothstein, Methods Enzymol. 101:202-211, 1983), were used to generate haploid strains containing mutations in the RP51A or RP51B genes or in both. Strains missing a normal RP51A gene grew poorly (180-min generation time versus 130 min for the wild type), whereas strains carrying a mutant RP51B were relatively normal. Strains carrying mutations in the two genes grew extremely poorly (6 to 9 h), which led us to conclude that RP51A and RP51B were both expressed. The results of Northern blot and primer extension experiments indicate that strains with a wild-type copy of the RP51B gene and a mutant (or deleted) RP51A gene grow slowly because of an insufficient amount of RP51 mRNA. The growth defect was completely rescued with additional copies of RP51B. The data suggest that RP51A contributes more RP51 mRNA (and more RP51 protein) than does RP51B and that intergenic dosage compensation, sufficient to rescue the growth defect of strains missing a wild-type RP51A gene, does not take place.
