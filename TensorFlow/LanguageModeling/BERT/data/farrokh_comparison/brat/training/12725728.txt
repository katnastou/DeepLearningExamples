The UCS domain protein She4p binds to myosin motor domains and is essential for class I and class V myosin function. 
BACKGROUND: Myosins are motor proteins involved in processes like cell motility, vesicle transport, or cytokinesis. In a variety of organisms, a novel group of proteins forming the UCS (UNC-45/CRO1/SHE4) domain-containing family are essential for proper myosin function. The Saccharomyces cerevisae UCS domain protein She4p is involved in two myosin-requiring events, endocytosis and mRNA localization. RESULTS: In contrast to UCS domain proteins from other organisms that interact with class II myosins, we demonstrate that She4p associates with yeast class I and class V myosins. She4p binds to motor domains of class V myosin Myo4p and class I myosin Myo5p, and this binding depends on She4p's UCS domain. In vivo, She4p is essential for the function and localization of Myo3p, Myo4p, and Myo5p (but not of Myo2p) and for colocalization of class I myosins with cortical actin patches. In vitro, She4p stimulates binding of Myo5p to filamentous actin. Wild-type She4p, but not a mutant lacking the UCS domain, accumulates in a cap-like structure at the bud tip. This localization requires Myo2p and actin, suggesting a Myo2-dependent mechanism by which She4p is targeted to the bud cap. Localization of She4p is essential for proper positioning and myosin-actin association of cortical Myo5p. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that She4p is a novel myosin motor domain binding protein and operates as a localized regulator of myosin function of class I and likely class V myosins.
