These data suggest that zfh1 is sufficient to promote transcription of some of the dMN guidance molecules in EWs but grn is not. However, both zfh1 and grn can work together with eve to transcriptionally reprogram EWs and regulate guidance receptors and CAMs normally expressed in dMNs. Additionally, the combinatorial expression of eve with zfh1 or grn induces a more robust transcriptional reprograming of EWs than each of them alone (Figure 6Q).
