To investigate the diversity of protein complexes, we selected the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae FBP1 complex. This homotetrameric complex is the rate-limiting enzyme in the yeast gluconeogenesis pathway and is rapidly expressed in the absence of sugar. However, when cells are replenished with glucose, glycolysis takes place and FBP1 is inactivated. To date, the full repertoire of regulatory events enabling activation and inactivation of FBP1 are yet to be deciphered. To follow FBP1 dynamics, we have grown yeast in the absence of glucose and then shifted the cells to glucose-containing medium. In parallel, we also exposed carbon starved yeast cells to heat shock, reasoning that this treatment may give rise to a distinct response. Then, using a single-step FLAG-affinity purification protocol, FBP1 was isolated from the three different growth conditions (glucose, carbon starved, and carbon starved+heat shock) and the composition of the complex was explored.
