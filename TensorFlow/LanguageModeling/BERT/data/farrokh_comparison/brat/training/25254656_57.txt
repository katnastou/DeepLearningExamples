Of particular interest is the observed direct correlation between intracellular inositol pyrophosphate levels and the time that S. pombe MT plus-ends stay at the cell tip before a catastrophe event. Components of a fungal growth zone can regulate MT plus-end dynamics as has been shown for A. nidulans Tea1 family member TeaA, which negatively regulates the activity of the XMAP215 protein AlpA. Thus it is feasible that Asp1 enzymatic activity regulates MT dynamics at the cell tip. Although immunofluorescence analysis of S. pombe Asp1-GFP did not show a specific cytoplasmic localization, localization of the human Vip1 member PPIP5K1 was slightly enhanced at the plasma membrane. Plasma membrane targeting of PPIP5K1 in NIH3T3 cells was increased dramatically following PtdIns3 kinase activation.
