Our data showed that over-expressed KIF5B-YFP transported dendritic Kv3.1aHA into axons. We wondered what is the determinant in this process. In our previous study, we generated Kv3.1b mutants with altered ATM in the C-terminal region. These mutants are restricted in somatodendritic regions. In the present study, we made Kv3.1 mutants with disrupted Zn2+-binding site in T1 and these mutants also failed to enter axons (Fig. 6). These mutants were co-transfected with KIF5B-YFP into neurons. Remarkably, over-expressed KIF5B-YFP brought all the Kv3.1 C-terminal mutants with an impaired ATM to penetrate the AIS and enter distal axons, but failed to affect any of the T1 mutants (Fig. 8E,F). Expression of KIF5B-YFP further increased Kv3.1bHA axonal levels (Fig. 8F). Therefore, over-expressed KIF5B-YFP assisted dendritic Kv3.1aHA and even Kv3.1 mutants with a faulty ATM to penetrate the AIS and enter the axon. Interestingly, this effect apparently requires properly assembled T1 domains, consistent with the hypothesis that T1 tetramerization is essential for binding to KIF5 and hence Kv3.1 targeting in axons (Figs. 5,6).
