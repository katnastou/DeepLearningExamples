We hypothesized that the delay in karyogamy might exacerbate the extra-spore phenotype of mal3Delta cells. To test this hypothesis, we constructed a mutant strain with deletions of both mal3 and dhc1, which encodes the dynein heavy chain, and a mutant strain with deletions of both mal3 and ssm4, which encodes the p150 glued subunit of the dynactin complex, since nuclear fusion is reportedly delayed in mutants lacking the dynein heavy chain. These double mutant strains showed the exaggerated phenotype, as expected (79% in mal3Delta dhc1Delta and 71% in mal3Delta ssm4Delta versus 21% in mal3Delta, Fig. 1B).
