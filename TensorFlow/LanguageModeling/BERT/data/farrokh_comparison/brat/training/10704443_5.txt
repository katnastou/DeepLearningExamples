The Emp24 complex in yeast comprises Emp24p, Erv25p, and most likely Erp1p and Erp2p. Deletion of EMP24 causes a strong reduction in the levels of the other three proteins of the complex (Belden and Barlowe 1996; Marzioch et al. 1999). In this study we provide evidence that the Emp24 complex is directly required for efficient packaging of Gas1p into ER-derived vesicles. Two subunits of this complex can be directly cross-linked to the cargo protein in purified ER-derived vesicles, consistent with the hypothesis that the Emp24 complex plays a role as a cargo receptor in ER to Golgi transport.
