Here we demonstrate that DNase II is required for the cell-autonomous degradation of DNA in dying NCs during developmental PCD. Further, we find that both dCAD and DNase II are required for distinct steps of NC nuclear breakdown during mid-oogenesis. Cell death in mid-oogenesis has characteristics of both apoptosis and autophagy, whereas developmental NC PCD appears to involve a distinct mechanism. We find that NCs become acidified during the final stages of PCD, and lysosomal genes are required for this process, suggesting that developmental NC PCD shows characteristics of programmed necrosis. These findings indicate that DNase II can act cell-autonomously to degrade DNA during non-apoptotic cell death.
