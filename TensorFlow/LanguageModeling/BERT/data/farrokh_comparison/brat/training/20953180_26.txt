Many intrinsically disordered eukaryotic proteins have been found to adopt folded structures upon binding to their biological targets. The "fly-casting" mechanism was proposed to explain the widespread occurrence of unfolded domains in eukaryotic proteins. This mechanism might also be applicable to the Pup-proteasome system. Full-length Pup alone is randomly coiled and extended under physiologically relevant conditions in vitro. The randomly coiled state of Pup may increase its target capture radius, allowing it to find the proteasomal ATPase more easily. Once the C-terminal part of Pup contacts the Mpa coiled-coil, the pupylated substrate is "reeled" into the proteasomal ATPase, and the Pup N-terminus is gradually forced towards the OB channel in Mpa. The pulling of Pup's N-terminus into the OB channel might subsequently pull the Pup helix away from the Mpa coiled-coil, causing Pup to unfold and thread further into the channel to reach the Mpa AAA region. This notion is supported by our structure demonstrating the displacement of the N-terminal half of the Pup helix (residues 21-30) from the Mpa coiled-coil (Fig. 2a-b), and by the observation that this region of Pup interacts more weakly with Mpa than the C-terminal half.
