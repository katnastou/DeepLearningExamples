The interaction between full-length MOR and GPR177 was verified in co-immunoprecipitation (CoIP) experiments. To demonstrate interaction, we tested the ability of an anti-MOR antibody to coimmunoprecipitate GPR177 from lysates prepared from HEK293 cells stably expressing FLAG-tagged MORs (293-MOR cells) and transiently transfected with a FLAG/6x His-tagged GPR177 construct. 293-MOR cells were a generous gift from Dr. Mark von Zastrow (UCSF). Preliminary Western blot analysis (Additional file 1, Figure S1A) revealed that the anti-MOR antibody specifically immunoprecipitated (IP) the mu-opioid receptor from 293-MOR cells. Lysates from transfected cells were immunoprecipitated using the anti-MOR antibody, and immunocomplexes probed with chicken anti-GPR177 antibodies. As shown in Figure 2B, an immunoreactive band of ~50 kDA, the predicted size of GPR177, was detected in lysates prepared from transfected cells with the anti-GPR177 antibody. A band migrating with the identical molecular mass was detected in the IP lane, but not in IPs from cells lacking MOR expression (-MOR lane), IPs from 293-MOR cells not transfected with GPR177 (-GPR lane), or mock IPs (mock lane). The specificity of the anti-GPR177 antisera was ascertained by transfecting a FLAG/6x His-tagged GPR177 cDNA into HEK293 cells. A Western blot containing lysate prepared from transfected cells was first probed with anti-FLAG antibodies, then stripped and reprobed with anti-GPR177 antibodies. A band migrating with the identical molecular mass was detected with anti-FLAG and anti-GPR177 antibodies (Additional file 1, Figure S1B), indicating that the GPR177 antibodies react specifically with GPR177.
