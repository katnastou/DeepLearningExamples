In ChIP assays, the wild-type Txnip promoter was precipitated by both NF-YA and NF-YB antibodies; Txnip promoters with single mutation at the CCAAT box or the inverted CCAAT box were also precipitated by NF-Y antibodies although the signals were reduced; however, the Txnip promoter with mutations at both CCAAT boxes was not pulled-down by NF-Y antibodies (Figure 8C). This confirms that both CCAAT boxes on Txnip promoter are targets of NF-Y, and both sites are required for optimal recruitment of NF-Y onto Txnip promoter.
