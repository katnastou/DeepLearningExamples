Effects of ML335, ML402, and arachidonic acid on K2P2.1(TREK-1) current at 0 mV were measured by whole cell patch-clamp experiments 24 hours after transfection. Acquisition and analysis were performed using pCLAMP9 and an Axopatch 200B amplifier (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA, USA). Pipette resistance ranged from 1 to 1.5 MOmega. Pipette solution contained the following, in millimolar: 145, KCl; 3, MgCl2; 5, EGTA and 20, HEPES (pH 7.2 with KOH). Bath solution contained the following, in millimolar: 145, NaCl; 5, KCl; 1, CaCl2; 3, MgCl2; 20, HEPES (pH 7.4 with NaOH). K2P2 (TREK-1) currents were elicited by a 1 second ramp from -100 to +50 mV from a -80 mV holding potential. After stabilization of the basal current, ML335 and ML402 were perfused at 200 ml hr-1 until potentiation was stably reached.
