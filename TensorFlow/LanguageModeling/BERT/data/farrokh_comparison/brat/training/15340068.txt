Sequestosome 1/p62 is a polyubiquitin chain binding protein involved in ubiquitin proteasome degradation. 
Herein, we demonstrate that the ubiquitin-associated (UBA) domain of sequestosome 1/p62 displays a preference for binding K63-polyubiquitinated substrates. Furthermore, the UBA domain of p62 was necessary for aggregate sequestration and cell survival. However, the inhibition of proteasome function compromised survival in cells with aggregates. Mutational analysis of the UBA domain reveals that the conserved hydrophobic patch MGF as well as the conserved leucine in helix 2 are necessary for binding polyubiquitinated proteins and for sequestration-aggregate formation. We report that p62 interacts with the proteasome by pull-down assay, coimmunoprecipitation, and colocalization. Depletion of p62 levels results in an inhibition of ubiquitin proteasome-mediated degradation and an accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins. Altogether, our results support the hypothesis that p62 may act as a critical ubiquitin chain-targeting factor that shuttles substrates for proteasomal degradation.
