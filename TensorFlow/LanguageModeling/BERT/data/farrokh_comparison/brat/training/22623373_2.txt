A fast and accurate method is reported to generate distance constraints between juxtaposited amino acids and to validate molecular models of halophilic protein complexes. Proteasomal 20S core particles (CPs) from the haloarchaeon Haloferax volcanii were used to investigate the quaternary structure of halophilic proteins based on their symmetrical, yet distinct subunit composition. Proteasomal CPs are cylindrical barrel-like structures of four-stacked homoheptameric rings of Alfa- and Beta-type subunits organized in Alfa(7)Beta(7) Beta(7)Alfa(7) stoichiometry. The CPs of H. volcanii are formed from a single type of Beta subunit associated with Alfa1 and/or Alfa2 subunits. Tandem affinity chromatography and new genetic constructs were used to separately isolate Alfa1(7)Beta(7)Beta(7)Alfa1(7) and Alfa2(7)Beta(7)Beta(7)Alfa2(7) CPs from H. volcanii. Chemically cross-linked peptides of the H. volcanii CPs were analyzed by high-performance mass spectrometry and an open modification search strategy to first generate and then to interpret the resulting tandem mass spectrometric data. Distance constraints obtained by chemical cross-linking mass spectrometry, together with the available structural data of nonhalophilic CPs, facilitated the selection of accurate models of H. volcanii proteasomal CPs composed of Alfa1-, Alfa2-, and Beta-homoheptameric rings from several different possible structures from Protein Data Bank.
