Previously we uncovered genes required for the trafficking of the vesicle soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor (v-SNARE) Snc1 in a genome-wide screen that assessed changes in the surface levels of the GFP-Snc1-Suc2 (GSS) reporter protein. Genetic and physical interaction analysis identified a cluster of four genes, representing three AP-1 subunits (Apm2, Apl4, and Aps1) and the uncharacterized Yfl034w, whose deletion increased surface GSS levels. The identification of Apm2, but not the more abundant mu-subunit isoform Apm1, was unexpected and suggested that Apm2-containing AP-1R complex has a specific role in Snc1 sorting. To confirm these observations, we used a quantitative assay that measures the invertase (Suc2) activity of GSS present at the cell surface (Figure 1A). Loss of APM2, APL4, and APS1 led to a slight but significant increase in GSS surface levels, comparable to that of the endocytosis mutant yap1801. This increase was not observed in the absence of APM1, showing that GSS sorting is an AP-1R-specific function and does not require the Apm1-containing AP-1 complex, which we will refer to here as AP-1.
