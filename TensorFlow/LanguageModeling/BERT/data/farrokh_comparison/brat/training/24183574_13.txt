Abutting the F pocket-divider in fly Pygo is a striking groove, walled by F773 and E767, and floored by the aromatic ring of F765 (Figures 1C and 2A). This groove is not seen in human Pygo in which a conserved L (L345) fills out the equivalent space, substituting for F765 (Figures 1D, 2B, and 2C), as already mentioned. In classical PHD fingers (e.g., from ING2), a deep cavity is found in this position which buries R2 (Figures 1E and 2D). Therefore, Drosophila Pygo PHD evolved a distinct feature--the R2 groove.
