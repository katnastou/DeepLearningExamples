In addition, HDAC2 KD did not affect NF-kappaB expression, nuclear translocation (Fig. 3 A), or NF-kappaB-DNA binding (Fig. 3 B). We confirmed previous data showing that Dex increased GR and HDAC2 association with the p65-NF-kappaB complex (Fig. 3 A). However, GR was not recruited to the p65-NF-kappaB complex after HDAC2 KD (Fig. 3 A). Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) analysis showed that Dex failed to inhibit histone 4 acetylation at the p65-NF-kappaB binding site in the GM-CSF promoter region after HDAC2 KD (Fig. 3 C). Thus, HDAC2 KD did not reduce the ability of GR to induce GR-sensitive gene expression but had a preferential effect on the suppression of NF-kappaB-mediated inflammatory gene expression.
