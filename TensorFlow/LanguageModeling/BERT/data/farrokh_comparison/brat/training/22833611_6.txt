Rrp44 contains a conserved CCCH motif. (A) Top: Diagram depicting the five recognized domains in Rrp44 and the CR3 motif. PIN denotes the endonuclease domain, CSD1 and CSD2 denote RNA-binding cold shock domains, RNB denotes the exonuclease domain and S1 denotes an RNA-binding S1 domain. Collectively the CSD1, CSD2, RNB and S1 domains are responsible for exonuclease activity. Bottom: the N-terminus of Rrp44p contains a conserved CCCH motif (black letters) in addition to the catalytic residues of the PIN domain (white letters). (B) Overview of the Rrp44 structure (colored as in panel A) bound to exosome subunits Rrp41 and Rrp45 (PDB ID 2WP8; 13). (C) The three conserved Cys residues and the conserved His residue form a tetrahedral cluster in the crystal structure. Note that the sulfur atom of Cys47 was not modeled. (D) The CR3 motif is physically connected to the exosome-binding site (Y40, R42 and D44) and the endonuclease active site of the PIN domain (D91, D171 and D198). Note that the D198 side chain was not modeled. Structures were rendered using PyMOL (The PyMOL Molecular Graphics System, Version 1.5.0.1 Schroedinger, LLC.).
