The ATPase activity of wild-type Rad51 becomes significant after the addition of poly(dT) as DNA substrate, displaying saturation at a stoichiometry above 12 nt per monomer Rad51 protein (Figure 2C), again in agreement with previous analyses. The ATPase activity of Rad51-K342E protein was stimulated by the addition of poly(dT) by about 30%, saturating with a similar stoichiometry as wild-type protein (Figure 2C).
