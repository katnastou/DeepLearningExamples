Our previous study showed that the major role of the loop lies in the recruitment of the microtubule-associated protein Dis1, a founding member of the TOG/XMAP215 microtubule-associated protein family, and in the ndc80-21 mutant (L405P), Dis1 delocalized from the mitotic kinetochore. Accordingly, we examined Dis1 localization in the ndc80-NH12 mutant and quantified its intensity. Intriguingly, the signal intensities of Dis1 at the mitotic kinetochore were indistinguishable from those of wild-type cells (Figure 4A).
