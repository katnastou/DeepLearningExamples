GFP-zip/MyoII in a zipper heterozygous background resulted in a mild rescue of the crossvein phenotypes (Table 1). Possible reasons for these observations are discussed later. GFP-zip/MyoII-Neck-Rod, zip/MyoII-Rod and GFP-zip/MyoII-Rod(DeltaNterm58) expressing wings often exhibited similar vein and crossvein phenotypes to those induced by zip/MyoII-HMM(DeltaCterm407)-GFP. Due to the severity of these other phenotypes the vein and crossvein phenotypes were difficult to document and quantify.
