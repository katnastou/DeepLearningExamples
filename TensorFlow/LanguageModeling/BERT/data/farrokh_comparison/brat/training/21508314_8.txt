To understand the mechanisms of aggregation and cellular toxicity caused by expansion of polyA tracts in yeast, we chose Pab1 as an initial example to expand its native polyA tract. Pab1 is a nuclear-cytoplasmic poly(Ade)-binding protein that is a component of the 3'-end mRNA-processing complex. Pab1 mediates interactions between the 5' cap structure and the 3' poly(Ade) tail of mRNA. We focused on Pab1 because it is similar to the human nuclear poly(Ade)-binding protein PABPN1, which possesses a polyA tract that when expanded results in OPMD, and is a homologue of PABPC1, which also possesses a polyA tract (Figure 1A). Expansion of PABPN1's polyA tract causes the protein to form aggregates in muscle cells and confers dominant-negative toxicity in the affected cells. Therefore we tested whether expansion of the yeast Pab1 polyA tract would cause aggregation and cellular dysfunction.
