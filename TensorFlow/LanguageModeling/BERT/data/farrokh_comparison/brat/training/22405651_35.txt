Similar to Cand1, Glmn binds to a broad range of CRLs although in a completely different manner. Cand1 associates with un-neddylated cullins not bound to SRs. In contrast, Glmn can bind to cullins independent of their neddylation status or association with SRs. However, the specific role of Cand1 in regulating CRL activity remains largely unknown. Depletion of Cand1 had little effect on the abundance of cullins and Cand1 only associates with a small fraction of un-neddylated cullins. Inhibition of neddylation with MLN4924 led to small increases in the fraction of cullins bound to Cand1 and little changes in cullin binding to SRs. Interestingly, loss of Cand1 function in C. elegans results in reduction of specific CRL functions while leaving others unaffected. Therefore, although Cand1 can bind to the broad class of unmodified Rbx1-Cullins, its impact on CRL activity is quite limited.
