The data presented in the current study also show that prostratin, a non-tumorigenic phorbol ester, and HMBA, a hybrid bipolar compound, are both able to enhance ELL2 accumulation and SECs formation despite their completely different structures and presumably distinct mechanisms of action. The enhancement correlates well with their abilities to decrease Siah1 expression and ELL2 polyubiquitination, although additional mechanisms may be used to further enhance ELL2 expression. For example, the ELL2 mRNA level was found to increase by about 2-fold upon the treatment with prostratin but not HMBA (data not shown).
