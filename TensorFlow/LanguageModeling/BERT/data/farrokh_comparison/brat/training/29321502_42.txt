Pex1-FLAG and His-Pex6 wild type and mutant complexes were co-expressed in E. coli BL21* (ThermoFisher Scientific) from the pETDuet and pCOLADuet vectors. The expression strain was grown in 6 L of DYT (16 g tryptone, 10 g yeast extract, 5 g NaCl) and appropriate antibiotics at 30 degreesC and induced at OD600 = 0.6-0.9 with IPTG (final concentration Cf=0.3 mM) before overnight incubation at 18 degreesC. The E. coli were harvested at 6000xg for 20 min at 4 degreesC, and the pellet was resuspended in Ni-A buffer (25 mM HEPES pH 7.6, 100 mM NaCl, 100 mM KCl, 10% glycerol, 10 mM MgCl2, 0.5 mM EDTA, 20 mM imidazole) with benzonase, lysozyme (0.2 mg mL-1), and protease inhibitors and frozen at -80 degreesC. Cells were lysed by sonication at 90 mA with 15 s pulses on, 90 s off for a total of 120 s on. Cell debris and unlysed cells were pelleted at 30,000xg, and the supernatant was transferred to conical tubes containing 5 mL of pre-washed Ni-NTA resin (HisPur Ni-NTA Resin, Thermo). The cell lysate and agarose were incubated with gentle rocking for 1-2 h at 4 degreesC before the agarose was batch washed with 2 x 50 mL washes of Ni_A with 1 mM ATP. After the batch washes, the agarose was poured into a gravity flow column and washed until the flowthrough contained no protein, as judged by a Bradford assay. The bound protein was then eluted with Ni_B buffer (25 mM HEPES pH 7.6, 100 mM NaCl, 100 mM KCl, 10% glycerol, 500 mM imidazole) with 1 mM ATP, and the elution was added to re-suspended and pre-washed anti-FLAG M2 affinity resin (Sigma) for 2 h of batch binding at 4 degreesC. After 2 h, the anti-FLAG affinity resin was poured into a gravity flow column, and washed with 50 mL of Ni_A with 1 mM ATP. The bound protein was eluted with Ni_A with 1 mM ATP and 0.3 mg mL-1 FLAG peptide and concentrated on a 100 MWCO spin concentrator before snap-freezing in liquid nitrogen. To separate the Pex1-FLAG/His-Pex6 hexamer from other oligomers, the concentrated FLAG elution was loaded on a Superose6 size exclusion column equilibrated in GF buffer (60 mM HEPES pH 7.6, 50 mM NaCl, 50 mM KCl, 10% glycerol, 10 mM MgCl2, 0.5 mM EDTA) with 1 mM ATP. The concentration of protein was determined by a Bradford assay. The amino acid changes in the ATPase motifs of Pex1 and Pex6 are as follows: Pex1-Walker B D2 (E798Q), Pex6-WB D2 (E832Q), Pex1-D2 poreloop (F771A), and Pex6-D2 pore loop (Y805A).
