UBQLNs were previously reported to localize to protein aggregates in SCA3 human tissue. Using a UBQLN2 selective antibody (Fig.S1), however, we did not detect UBQLN2 immunoreactivity in ATXN3 inclusions in mouse models of SCA3 or in human disease tissue. Mori et al used an anti-UBQLN antibody that non-selectively recognizes both UBQLN1 and UBQLN2 (Fig.S1) and thus prior results may not reflect actual colocalization of UBQLN2 to ATXN3 inclusions. In addition, UBQLN1 and UBQLN2 both can form cytoplasmic puncta when overexpressed in cells, even as wild type protein. In the absence of co-immunostaining with ATXN3, it is difficult to know whether UBQLN2-positive inclusions detected by immunohistochemistry in cell systems or human tissue reflect ATXN3 aggregates. Consistent with the results from SCA3 human disease tissue and mouse models, co- precipitation studies in cultured cells demonstrated that UBQLN2 fails to interact with normal ATXN3 or expanded ATXN3 protein. These findings suggest that ATXN3 may not be a substrate for UBQLN2-mediated clearance.
