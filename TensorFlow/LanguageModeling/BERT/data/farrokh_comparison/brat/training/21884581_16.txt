At 24 h before transfection, cells (2 x 105-aliquots) were plated in 6-well plates and transfected with increasing amounts of B7.1-YPet-, B7-H1-YPet- or IR-YPet-expressing plasmids (10 to 500 ng/well), and constant amounts (10 ng-aliquots) of plasmid expressing B7-H1-Rluc8 or B7.1-Rluc8 fusion protein. 48 h later, cells were collected and washed twice with PBS, and aliquots were placed in 384-well plates. Coelenterazine H substrate was added at a final molarity of 5 muM, and BRET was measured immediately. To analyze the effect of the penton, cells were incubated for 5 min without or with penton protein solution at 0.33, 0.66 or 132 ng/muL, followed by Coelenterazine H addition and BRET measurement. BRET was monitored using a lumino/fluorometer (Mithras; Berthold Technologies, France), allowing for the sequential integration of luminescence with two filter settings (Rluc filter, 485 +/- 10 nm; YFP filter, 530 +/- 12.5 nm). The emission signal values obtained at 530 nm were divided by the emission signal values obtained at 485 nm. The BRET ratio was calculated by dividing the emission signal value obtained with coexpressed donor and acceptor by that obtained with the donor protein expressed alone. Data from at least three independent experiments were averaged, and results expressed as milliBRET (mBRET), corresponding to the BRET ratio multiplied by 1,000. Donor saturation curves were determined as previously described.
