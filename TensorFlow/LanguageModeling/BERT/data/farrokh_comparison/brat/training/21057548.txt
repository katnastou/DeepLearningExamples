CtBPs promote mitotic fidelity through their activities in the cell nucleus. 
CtBPs form NADH-sensitive chromatin-modifying complexes, which link cellular metabolism to gene transcription. They also function in the cytoplasm to regulate Golgi fissioning; their inhibition can consequently cause a Golgi-dependent checkpoint in G(2). We have recently identified a novel role of CtBPs in the maintenance of mitotic fidelity; inhibition of CtBP synthesis resulting in reduced association of aurora B with mitotic chromatin and aberrant segregation of chromosomes. Here, we demonstrate that it is the interaction of CtBPs with transcriptional regulators and/or chromatin-modifying enzymes in the cell nucleus, rather than their role in Golgi fission, which is critical for the maintenance of mitotic fidelity.
