A striking feature of KPNA7 is its localization to the nucleus under steady state conditions, while KPNA2 is predominantly cytoplasmic. This nuclear localization suggests that nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of KPNA7 differs from that of the other members of the importin alpha family. There are three possibilities for the altered subcellular distribution; 1) enhanced nuclear import by importin beta; 2) decreased nuclear export by CAS; and 3) inefficient release of KPNA7 from target NLS, resulting in nuclear retention. The most likely of these situations, given our evidence that KPNA7 binds importin beta with much higher affinity than other a family members is that this enhanced binding results in increased nuclear import of KPNA7.
