As piRNA clusters are the primary source of transposon-targeting piRNAs, we analyzed changes in piRNAs mapping uniquely to the genome, ensuring that they were in fact derived from the corresponding cluster (Fig. 6B,C). We found that piRNAs from germline (42AB and Cluster 3) and soma (flam and traffic jam) as well as clusters expressed in both tissues (Cluster 2) were dramatically reduced in the absence of vret (Fig. 6B,C).
