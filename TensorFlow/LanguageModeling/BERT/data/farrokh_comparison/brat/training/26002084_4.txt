Although several hundred proteins are thought to be concentrated at centrioles, only a small number appear to form a conserved 'core' pathway that is essential for centriole assembly. During canonical centriole duplication, the protein kinase Plk4/Sak/ZYG-1 is recruited to the mother centriole by SPD-2 in worms, by Asterless (Asl) in flies, or by a combination of the two (Cep192 and Cep152, respectively) in humans. The protein kinase recruits STIL/Ana2/SAS-5 and Sas-6 to a single site on the side of the mother centriole where they assemble with CPAP/Sas-4 into a cartwheel structure that helps to establish the ninefold symmetry of the centriole. CPAP/Sas-4 can interact with tubulin and is required to recruit the centriole MTs to the outer region of the cartwheel, possibly working together with Cep135/Bld10 --although no homologue of this protein has been identified in worms, and it does not appear to be essential for centriole duplication in flies.
