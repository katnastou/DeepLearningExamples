ChIP shows Sub1-association with G4 DNA in vivo. Chromatin immunoprecipitation was carried out with anti-FLAG antibody and chromatin fractions prepared from yeast cells with indicated genetic backgrounds. In all strains, 3XFLAG epitope tagged SUB1 allele was present. 5'BGL and STP primers anneal within LYS2 ORF, ~100 and ~3000 bp from the Smu sequence insertion site, respectively. YDR primers anneal to YDR554C region of the yeast genome. All primer sequences are in Supplementary Table S1. All values are based on four independent experiments and the standard deviations are indicated by error bars. (A) Transcription from pTET was repressed by culturing cells in rich media with 2mug/ml doxycycline. (B) Cells were cultured in rich media with no doxycycline to ensure pTET is fully turned on. P values were calculated by Student's t-test.
