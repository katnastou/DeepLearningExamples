(A) Rpn11 activation during proteasome incorporation monitored by ubiquitin-AMC hydrolysis. Fluorescence time courses for the isolated WT lid and Rpn11 (AxA) lid are shown in blue and red, respectively. Background DUB activity of proteasomes reconstituted with Rpn11 (AxA) lid is shown in green, and the activity of proteasomes reconstituted with WT lid is shown in orange. The difference between the time courses for proteasomes reconstituted with WT and Rpn11 (AxA) lid corresponds to Rpn11-dependent DUB activity. (B) Quantification of the ubiquitin-AMC cleavage activities for WT and Rpn11 (AxA) proteasomes shown in a. (C) Normalized Ubiquitin-AMC hydrolysis activity of Rpn11-containing complexes in isolation (grey bars) and background-corrected activity of Rpn11 in proteasomes reconstituted with different lid variants (dark grey bars). Error bars in b and c correspond to 1 standard deviation of the data (n = 3).
