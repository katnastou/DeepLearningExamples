The first distinction is the manner in which the surface of the S1-S4 domain forms its contacts with the pore. In the Kv channel the voltage sensor's interaction with the pore occurs mainly through the extracellular half of S1 and through the S4-S5 linker (Fig. 3). This configuration leaves the charged S4 helix free to move in response to voltage differences across the membrane and exert force on the S4-S5 linker to gate the channel. In Slo2.2 the extracellular half of S1, nearly the entire S4, and a helix from the S1-S2 connecting segment form an extensive contact surface with the pore. The Kv voltage sensor and Slo2.2 S1-S4 domains have essentially the same helical structure, but their different orientations with respect to the pore reconfigure the contact surface (Fig. 3). In Slo2.2 S4 runs antiparallel to and in close contact with S5, as if its function is to help glue the S1-S4 domain to the pore rather than to provide a mobile voltage sensor. This possibility is consistent with the amino acid sequence of Slo2.2, which shows two positive and two negative charged amino acids in or near S4 instead of the excess positive charges observed in Kv channel S4s and in the S4 sequence of Slo1 and Slo3. Further, mutations involving these positive and negative charges in Slo2.2 do not produce large changes in voltage-dependence. Thus, S1-S4 does not appear to function as a mobile voltage sensor in Slo2.2. We further note a surprising observation, which may be related to the differences in S4: we cannot detect cryo-EM density for an S4-S5 helical linker in Slo2.2. Higher resolution data will be required to tell whether this linker is partially disordered or simply not present as a helix. Its absence in Slo2.2 is conspicuous, and implies that this region serves a different function than in Kv channels.
