Mutations in two other genes required only for the bipolar budding pattern, BUD8 and BUD9, result in a more specific defect, a unipolar budding pattern. bud8 mutants bud only from the proximal pole and bud9 mutants bud only from the distal pole. These phenotypes suggest that different mechanisms are used for placing the cue at the two poles and/or that different cues are used to mark the distal and proximal poles.
