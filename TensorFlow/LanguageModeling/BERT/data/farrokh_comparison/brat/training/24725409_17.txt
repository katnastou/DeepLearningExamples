Using pull-down assays performed under stringent conditions, we further characterized the homophilic and heterophilic interactions mediated by PCDH24. We generated 6xHis and FLAG-tagged EDs from PCDH24 and both isoforms of MLPCDH (Fig. 4A).. Co-incubation of differentially tagged versions of PCDH24 did not reveal homophilic interactions by pull-down analysis, most likely because the interaction is too weak to be detected by this method (Fig. 4D). PCDH24 was found, however, to interact strongly with both isoforms of MLPCDH (Fig. 4D). This interaction was again specific to the PCDH24 N-terminus, as deletion of the first EC domain abolished binding. Thus, PCDH24 and MLPCDH interact in trans to form Ca2+-dependent adhesion complexes.
