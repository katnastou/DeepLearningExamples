Since Cdk5 is essential for neuronal migration, the physiological role of Cdk5-mediated talin phosphorylation was assessed in neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells. We transfected these cells with EGFP-talin, -talS425A or -talS425D, and cell migration was measured using transwell assays. Whereas the migration of cells expressing EGFP- talin was stimulated by PDGF, expression of EGFP-talS425A or EGFP-talS425D markedly retarded PDGF-induced cell migration (Fig. 2a; Supplementary Information, Fig. S2a). Moreover, roscovitine inhibited PDGF-induced migration of SH-SY5Y cells in a dose-dependent manner (Supplementary Information, Fig. S2b), and reducing Cdk5 expression by shRNA knockdown also significantly inhibited neuroblastoma cell migration (Supplementary Information, Fig. S2c).
