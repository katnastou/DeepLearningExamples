We have also reported that polyubiquitinated proteins accumulate in not4Delta cell extracts. So we compared the level of polyubiquitinated proteins in total extracts and in protein aggregates from wild-type and mutant cells lacking the enzymatic modules of the Ccr4-Not complex (Fig. 2A, middle panel). No increased level of polyubiquitinated proteins was detected in total extracts from caf1Delta or ccr4Delta cells compared to wild type. In contrast, in not4Delta cells polyubiquitinated proteins were observed in total extracts. A slight increase of polyubiquitinated proteins was observed in the aggregates from caf1Delta and ccr4Delta mutants, whereas very high levels of polyubiquitinated proteins were found in the aggregates from not4Delta cells. These aggregates in not4Delta contained the Hsp70 cytoplasmic chaperone, Ssa1; the ribosome associated chaperones Ssb1 and Egd2; the proteasomal protein, Rpn8; and the ribosomal protein, Rpl35 (Fig. 2A, lower panel).
