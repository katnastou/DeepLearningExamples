Our in vitro reaction measures the last step of inheritance, the fusion of vacuoles, but relies on a sequence of coupled steps which represents earlier stages in the pathway as well. Thus, the first step of inheritance to be observed in vivo, the creation of a segregation structure which projects into the bud, is also seen in our in vitro reaction and requires the vac-encoded proteins. Recent studies (Fanton, V., and W. Wickner, unpublished) indicate that structure formation requires Sec17 and Sec18 proteins, further connecting it to the early stages of the in vitro reaction as assayed biochemically. Analysis of the in vitro reaction thus offers insight into several stages of the organelle inheritance process.
