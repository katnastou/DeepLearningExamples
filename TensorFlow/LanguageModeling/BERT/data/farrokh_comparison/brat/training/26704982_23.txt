The anticodon stem of tRNA-A establishes cross-subunit contacts with the catalytic domain of MST1-B (Figure 1B). In the bacterial complex, the cross-dimer interactions with the anticodon stem of tRNAThr were sequence non-specific. In a sharp contrast, our structure reveals that MST1-B specifically recognizes the first two base pairs of the anticodon stem (i.e. U27:A43 and U28:A42) and the first base in the variable arm (i.e. A44) in tRNA2Thr (Figure 5A). The anticodon stem of tRNA-A sits atop alpha5-beta6 loop (residues 142-150) and beta12-beta13 turn (residues 302-313). There, Lys306 forms a H-bond with the O2 atom in the base of U27, whereas the side chain of Asn310 makes contacts with the O2 and N3 atoms of U28 and A43, respectively. Also, the side-chain NH2 group of Lys306 and the side-chain OH of Tyr312 coordinate a water molecule that, in turn, makes polar contacts with the 2'OH and the N3 imino of A44. The sugar-phosphate backbone flanking U27:A43, U28:A42 and A44 is stabilized through contacts with side chains of Ser146, Tyr147 and Asn148.
