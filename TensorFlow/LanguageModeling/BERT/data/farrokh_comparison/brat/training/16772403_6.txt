Ribosome biogenesis in yeast involves the synthesis of a 35S polycistronic rRNA precursor (pre-rRNA) that is processed in large pre-ribosomal particles at several well-defined sites to produce the mature 18S, 5.8S and 25S rRNAs [for a recent review see ]. This process requires over 200 proteins and hundreds of small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs), which function in cleavage and chemical modification of pre-rRNA via complementary base pairing interactions with the rRNA. A total of 18 putative RNA helicases are involved in pre-rRNA processing and ribosome assembly. Mutational studies of RNA helicases involved in ribosome biogenesis revealed that conserved amino acids predicted to be involved in ATP binding and hydrolysis are important for cell viability, suggesting that they may indeed function as RNA helicases. Thus far, only four of the 18 proteins (Dbp4, Rok1, Dbp9 and Has1) have been characterized in vitro and have been shown to harbor ATPase activity. Two of these proteins (Dbp9 and Has1) were also able to separate artificial nucleic acid duplexes in vitro, suggesting that they are indeed helicases. However, biochemical evidence to support this hypothesis for the other 14 helicases is lacking.
