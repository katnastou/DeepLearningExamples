The intermediate truncation allele YHC1-(1-189) displayed a spectrum of mutational synergies in different genetic backgrounds. Because YHC1-(1-189) mud1Delta cells grew about as well as YHC1 mud1Delta cells at all temperatures tested (Figure 11, bottom panel), whereas YHC1-(1-170) mud1Delta cells were inviable, we surmise that the Yhc1 segment from aa 171 to 189 is genetically redundant with the Mud1 subunit of the U1 snRNP. We found that YHC1-(1-189) mud2Delta cells grew well at lower temperatures (18-25degreesC) but were tightly ts and failed to thrive at 34-37degreesC (Figure 11, bottom panel). In comparison with the lethality of mud2Delta to YHC1-(170) and the normal growth of YHC1 mud2Delta cells, this result signifies that the Yhc1 segment from aa 171 to 189 compensates for the absence of Mud2 at low temperatures, whereas the Yhc1 segment from aa 190 to 212 is required to buffer Mud2 loss at high temperatures. The YHC1-(1-189) tgs1Delta strain displayed a mild synthetic defect compared with the YHC1 tgs1Delta, seen as smaller colony size at 34-37degreesC (not shown) and scored as ++ growth (Figure 11). Given that tgs1Delta was lethal with YHC1-(1-170), we invoke genetic redundancy of Yhc1-(171-189) with the TMG cap.
