Osh proteins regulate phosphoinositide metabolism at ER-plasma membrane contact sites. 
Sac1 phosphoinositide (PI) phosphatases are essential regulators of PI-signaling networks. Yeast Sac1, an integral endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane protein, controls PI4P levels at the ER, Golgi, and plasma membrane (PM). Whether Sac1 can act in trans and turn over PI4P at the Golgi and PM from the ER remains a paradox. We find that Sac1-mediated PI4P metabolism requires the oxysterol-binding homology (Osh) proteins. The PH domain-containing family member, Osh3, localizes to PM/ER membrane contact sites dependent upon PM PI4P levels. We reconstitute Osh protein-stimulated Sac1 PI phosphatase activity in vitro. We also show that the ER membrane VAP proteins, Scs2/Scs22, control PM PI4P levels and Sac1 activity in vitro. We propose that Osh3 functions at ER/PM contact sites as both a sensor of PM PI4P and an activator of the ER Sac1 phosphatase. Our findings further suggest that the conserved Osh proteins control PI metabolism at additional membrane contact sites.
