Previously, we have genetically and molecularly characterized the functions of PCFS4 in flowering time control. We found that the flowering delay of the pcfs4 mutants could be partially explained by the effects of PCFS4 on the alternative processing of FCA pre-mRNA. In addition to its delayed flowering, pcfs4 mutants also showed other phenotypes including reduced vigor of their seedlings, altered leaf shape and inflorescence phyllotaxy (Figure 1). In the early seedling stage, mutant plants were significantly smaller than the wild type (Figure 1A). Leaf edges of pcfs4-1 were more curved down towards its abaxial side (Figure 1B). The siliques of pcfs4-1 mutants formed a larger angle with its stem in contrast to that in wild type Col (Figure 1C). Albeit all these defects, the mutant remained quite healthy throughout its whole life cycle in the standard growth conditions, suggesting that PCFS4 is not essential for the viability of the plants. Supporting this conclusion is that the expression of PCFS4 is not ubiquitous, but instead, tissue-specific and developmentally regulated. The non-essential nature of PCFS4 for plant viability and specific developmental defects of pcfs4 mutants support a hypothesis that PCFS4 might specifically target on a subset of genes.
