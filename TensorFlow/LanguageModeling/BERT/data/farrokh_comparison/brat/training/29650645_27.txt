Here, we describe the discovery of a surveillance mechanism, mitoCPR, that detects mitochondrial import stress and protects mitochondrial functions in response. We propose that the mitoCPR effector Cis1 recruits Msp1 to the outer membrane translocase to clear stalled proteins from the translocase thereby improving mitochondrial import (Fig. 7F). This response is essential to protect mitochondrial functions and to maintain the mitochondrial genome during import stress. Recently, it was discovered that translation by ribosomes at the surface of mitochondria can stall. Whether the Msp1-Cis1 complex can clear preproteins from ribosomes during co-translational import or whether the complex only recognizes post-translationally imported proteins remains to be determined. We also do not yet know whether Cis1 and Msp1 improve mitochondrial import solely by clearing un-imported proteins. Our data suggest that they may also aid in the import process itself. Mitochondrial preproteins must be kept unfolded in order to translocate into mitochondria. A delay in mitochondrial import could result in premature folding and perhaps even aggregation of preproteins at the organelle's surface. We speculate that Msp1, whose ATPase domain faces the cytosol, could unfold prematurely folding or aggregated preproteins giving them a second chance to translocate into mitochondria or, when this does not occur, target them for degradation (Fig. 7F).
