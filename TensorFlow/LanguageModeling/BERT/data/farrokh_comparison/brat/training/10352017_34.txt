Once properly positioned, the yeast spindle elongates through the bud neck. Elongation of the spindle reflects concerted changes in kinetochore, pole to pole, and interdigitating microtubules that undergo simultaneous polymerization, depolymerization, and sliding within the nucleus, as well as pulling forces on the nucleus generated by cytoplasmic microtubules. It follows a biphasic pattern consisting of an initial rapid elongation phase followed by a period of slower continued elongation. The initial phase of spindle elongation was mildly reduced in bim1Delta cells, at 0.41 mum/min, compared to 0.59 mum/min in BIM1 cells (P = 0.07, n = 7), while the slow phases were equivalent at 0.18 mum/min in bim1Delta cells and 0.22 mum/min in BIM1 cells. This small decrease in the initial, rapid phase of spindle elongation in bim1Delta cells suggests a subtle effect of Bim1p on some microtubule populations later in the cell cycle, and it could be due to an effect on either nuclear (pushing) or cytoplasmic (pulling) microtubules.
