Phosphatidylserine exposure on the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane was detected by the Annexin V-FITC apoptosis detection Kit (Cayman Chemical, Ann Arbor, MI) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, 1 x 106 cells were pelleted following treatment and washed in PBS. Cells were then resuspended in 500 mul of binding buffer, mixed with Annexin V-FITC and propidium iodide (PI) and incubated at room temperature for 10 min in the dark. The Annexin V-positive cells were analyzed by flow cytometry using BD FACSCalibur flow cytometer (BD, Franklin Lakes, NJ)
