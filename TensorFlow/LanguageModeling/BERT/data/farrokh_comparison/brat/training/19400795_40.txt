Extracellular proteases regulate enterococcal fratricide. A. Detection of GFP immunoreactivity in stationary phase predator-prey co-culture supernatants. Predator (V583, GelE+SprE+; VT01, GelE-SprE+; VT02, GelE+SprE-; and VT03, GelE-SprE-) and prey (VT12, GelE-SprE- GFP+) were co-inoculated at a 20:1 ratio of prey: predator and grown overnight at 37degreesC prior to immunodetection of GFP. B. Effect of extracellular proteases on lysis of VT03 (GelE-SprE-). Differences in lysis rates of VT03 in the absence or presence of extracellular proteases (GelE and SprE) are exhibited as percent values of initial optical density at 600 nm. VT03 was incubated alone (*) or in the presence of 100 ng of GelE (*), SprE (^) or GelE and SprE (v;) together over a period of 12 hours at 37degreesC. Data are mean +/- SE of three independent trials with each performed in triplicate.
