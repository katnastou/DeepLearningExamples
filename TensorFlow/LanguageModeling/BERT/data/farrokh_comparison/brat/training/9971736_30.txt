In this study, we have shown that FEZ1 interacts with PKCzeta in vivo and its intracellular localization is regulated by the PKCzeta activity. By the transient expression assay, FEZ1 protein was found to stimulate the caPKCzeta-induced neuronal differentiation of PC12 cells. On the other hand, in the NGF-induced neuronal differentiation of PC12 cells, a PKCzeta substrate "nucleolin" was proposed recently to play a pivotal role in the connection between cell surface signaling and nucleus in PC12 cells. Although it has been shown that the intracellular localization of nucleolin is changed by the activation of PKCzeta in the NGF-induced neuronal differentiating PC12 cells, there is no structural similarity between nucleolin and FEZ1. Furthermore, no direct evidence is available showing that nucleolin enhances the caPKCzeta-induced neuronal differentiation of PC12 cells. Thus, it is unclear whether or not there is any functional relationship between nucleolin and FEZ1.
