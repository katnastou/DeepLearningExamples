As an integral subunit of the proteasome complex, Rpn1 associates with several neighboring subunits in the 19S. Does this leave sufficient surface area exposed to bind its ligands such as UBLs or polyUb? From current cryoEM-derived proteasome models (PDB 4cr2), Rpn1 is situated peripherally on the 19S RP touching two AAA ATPase subunits Rpt1 and Rpt2 (Figure S3). Not surprisingly, most evolutionary conserved residues on the surface of Rpn1 identified with the ConSurf server contacted neighboring subunits Rpt1 and Rpt2 when incorporated into the proteasome, although a few exposed residues that are not in direct contact with any other proteasome subunit are also highly conserved between Rpn1 sequences across eukaryotes (Figure S3). By focusing on Rpn1 (chain Z in PDB 4cr2) and its two nearest neighbors, it becomes apparent that half of the PC toroid (see previous paragraph) is solvent-exposed suitably positioned to serve as a docking station for substrates or substrate-shuttles possibly explaining the presence of highly conserved exposed residues (Figure 4F, S3).
