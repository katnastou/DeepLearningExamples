In the complex, 12 NKp30 residues contact 11 B7-H6 residues through predominantly hydrophobic interactions, with no bound water molecules in the interface (Fig. 5 A; Table II). The three potential N-linked glycosylation sites of NKp30 are located outside the interface with B7-H6 and so should not interfere with binding. The NKp30-B7-H6 complex buries a total solvent-accessible surface of only 1,130 Aa2, of which 578 Aa2 is contributed by NKp30 and 552 Aa2 by B7-H6. This small interface, which is similar in size to that of the CTLA-4-B7-1 complex (1,250 Aa2) but substantially less than the interface of the PD-1-PDL1 complex (1,900 Aa2), is at the lower limit of the mean value of 1,600 (+/-400) Aa2 for stable protein-protein complexes. However, the interface is characterized by high shape complementarity, based on a calculated shape correlation statistic (Sc) of 0.77 (Sc = 1.0 for interfaces with geometrically perfect fits), which is at the upper end of the range for protein-protein complexes. This high Sc value is readily explained by the topologies of the contacting surfaces, whereby the FG loop of B7-H6 forms a prominent bulge on the surface of the ligand which fits snugly into a deep groove between strands FG and helix alpha2 of the NKp30 receptor that is unique to this CD28 family receptor (Fig. 5 B). The high shape complementarity of the NKp30-B7-H6 interface, which is also characterized by the complete exclusion of bulk solvent, probably compensates for its small size to achieve sufficient affinity for NK cell activation.
