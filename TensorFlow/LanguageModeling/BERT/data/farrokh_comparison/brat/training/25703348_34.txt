In mammals, SCML2 is an MBT domain-containing protein that is essential in the male germline. Our results suggest that germline-specific expression of SCML2 is related to its function in establishing germline-specific features. Although a previous study suggested that mammalian Scm homologs have redundant functions and compensate for the loss of Scmh1, in this study we found that the phenotype of the Scml2-KO is distinct from that of the Scmh1-KO and that the function of SCML2 is not redundant with that of SCMH1. Thus, SCML2 has a unique function in the germline that cannot be compensated by other MBT domain-containing proteins. A recent study suggested that human SCML2 is expressed ubiquitously in somatic tissues, so it would be intriguing to examine the difference between human SCML2 and mouse SCML2.
