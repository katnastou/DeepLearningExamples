The pipeline we used to uncover the Dsn1-N (Box 1) motif in a wide distribution of eukaryotes is based on a previously established workflow termed ConFeaX (Tromer et al.). Orthologous sequences were masked using IUpred (Dosztanyi et al.) (disorder/order threshold = 0.4) and MARCOIL (Delorenzi and Speed) (coiled-coil threshold = 90). ConFeaX starts with a probabilistic search for short conserved regions (6-100 aa) in masked orthologs using the MEME algorithm (option: any number of repeats) (Bailey et al.). Significant motif hits are extended on both sides by five residues to compensate for the strict treatment of alignment information by the MEME algorithm and aligned using MAFFT-LINSI (Katoh and Standley) to introduce gaps. The alignments were modelled using the HMMER packing (Eddy) and sensitive profile HMM searches (using jackhmmer) were iterated (E-value =1) until convergence. In some cases, we manually optimised the HMM profile searches using permissive bit scores and removed obvious false hits. Subsequently, for each of the conserved features, a phylogenetic profile was derived (present is '1' and absent is '0'). For all possible pairs, we determined the correlation/similarity using Pearson correlation coefficient (Wu et al.). Pearson distances (D = 1 - r) were used to map the phylogenetic profile similarity of kinetochore proteins in 2D using Barnes-Hut t-SNE (Maaten and Hinton) (R-package 'Rtsne' [perplexity = 5, dimensions = 2 and theta = 0], see Fig. 1). Sequence logos depicted throughout this study were obtained using weblogo2 (Crooks et al.).
