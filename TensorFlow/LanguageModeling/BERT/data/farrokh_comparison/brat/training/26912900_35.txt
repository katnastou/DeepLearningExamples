The ability of the T1 site of Rpn1 to bind both ubiquitin and UBL proteins that shuttle ubiquitinated substrates to the proteasome applies to all intrinsic substrate receptor sites of the proteasome. The multiplicity of intrinsic substrate receptors on the proteasome, taken together with the combinatorial array of states associated with loading of multiple extrinsic receptors on any intrinsic receptor, should allow for tens and possibly hundreds of distinct receptor states for binding of ubiquitin conjugates. The utilization of multiple sites for substrate recognition, not all showing high affinity, is consistent with a multipoint, avid mode of ubiquitin chain recognition, which may be associated with highly dynamic interactions between ubiquitin receptors and the proteasome-bound substrate. Substrate binding is thought to be productive for proteolysis only if it results in the presentation of an unstructured initiation site into the substrate translocation channel of the ATPase ring. A dynamic mode of ubiquitin chain binding may allow for the body of the substrate to present alternative orientations to the proteasome so as to achieve productive positioning of the initiation site. In summary, this work defines a new pathway in the proteasome that engages substrates by using avid low affinity binding sites, and places them in the neighborhood of deubiquitinating enzyme Ubp6 and the ATPase ring.
