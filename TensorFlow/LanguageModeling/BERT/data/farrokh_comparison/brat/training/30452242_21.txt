To further interrogate the interaction of Ssp2 and Smk1, we utilized a bacterial expression strategy that incorporates non-natural cross-linkable amino acids at specific positions within a target protein. This system utilizes an aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase that charges an engineered amber suppressor tRNA with the non-natural amino acid p-benzoyl-l-phenylalanine (Bpa). Upon exposure to UV light, the Bpa side chain can form covalent bonds with carbon atoms that are within 4 Aa. Amber codons were introduced at various positions in a plasmid that directs the inducible expression of both SMK1 and SSP2KAD-GST. These plasmids and a second plasmid that directs the expression of the tRNA and synthetase were co-transformed into bacteria, and transformants were induced in medium containing Bpa. Subsequently, samples were irradiated with UV and resolved by electrophoresis in denaturing gels, and Smk1 or Ssp2 proteins detected by immunoblot analyses. If the amber suppressible residue in one of the Smk1/Ssp2KAD-GST proteins is within 4 Aa of a C atom of the second protein, new electrophoretic species approximating the combined masses of Smk1 and the Ssp2KAD-GST complex may be detected.
