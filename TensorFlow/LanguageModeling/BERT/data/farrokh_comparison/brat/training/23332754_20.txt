To address the formation of UNC-45 chains, we generated three distinct mutants affecting the two faces of the UNC-45 multimerization site formed by helices of the TPR domain (motif-1) and the neck domain (motif-2). Two mutants comprise site-specific exchanges in motif-1 (L121W) and motif-2 (V480R/V484R), respectively, whereas the DeltaTPR mutant lacks the entire motif-1. Though all three interface mutants blocked chain formation in vitro, the structural data suggest that the DeltaTPR mutant should show the strongest effect in impairing UNC-45 oligomer function in vivo. It is thus surprising that the double arginine mutant V480R/V484R exhibits the most pronounced defects and could not rescue the temperature-dependent locomotion phenotype of unc-45(m94) ts mutants, whereas expression of the two TPR transgenes (L121W and DeltaTPR) rescued motility at least partially.
