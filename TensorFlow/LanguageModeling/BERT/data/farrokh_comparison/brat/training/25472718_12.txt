Similar to DeltaPP1dis2, disruption of the PP1-binding sites within Klp5 or Klp6 also alleviated ndc80-NH12 growth defects, although Klp6(PP1mut) suppressed the defects better than Klp5(PP1mut) (Fig. 2A). It is of note that Klp5 contains two PP1-binding consensus sequences, whereas Klp6 contains only one, suggesting that the binding affinity of Klp5 and Klp6 to PP1 might not be the same. We envision that this altered property leads to the different efficacy of suppression towards ndc80-NH12. It is worth pointing out that the temperature sensitivity of ndc80-NH12 is not ameliorated by the full deletion of Klp5 (or Klp6), nor the truncation of the Klp5-Klp6 motor domains (supplementary material Fig. S2B). This is consistent with the notion that Klp5-Klp6 motors play crucial roles in regulating spindle length and microtubule dynamics in addition to PP1 recruitment. Overall, our data suggest that Klp5-Klp6 delivers PP1 to the attached kinetochores, thereby promoting SAC silencing.
