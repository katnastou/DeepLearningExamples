Ch organ SOP cells activate rho in a region-specific manner to differentially pattern the Drosophila embryo. In abdominal segments, for example, a set of five Ato-positive primary (1degrees) SOP cells (C1-C5) activate rho, secrete Spi, and thereby induce three secondary (2degrees) SOP cells and a cluster of oenocytes. In contrast, even though a similar set of Ato-positive 1degrees SOP cells forms within thoracic segments, these cells fail to up-regulate rho and 2degrees SOP cells and oenocytes do not form within the thorax. The differential ability of abdominal and thoracic SOP cells to activate rho is linked to the expression of a specific Hox factor, Abdominal-A (Abd-A). In the absence of Abd-A, the abdominal ch organ SOP cells fail to stimulate rho and lack Spi secretion, thereby preventing the induction of 2degrees SOP cells and oenocytes. What remains unclear is how the Ato proneural and Abd-A Hox pathways are integrated to stimulate gene expression within specific abdominal SOP cells.
