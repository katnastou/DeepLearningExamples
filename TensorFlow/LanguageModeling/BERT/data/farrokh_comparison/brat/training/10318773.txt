A newly identified member of tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily (TR6) suppresses LIGHT-mediated apoptosis. 
TR6 (decoy receptor 3 (DcR3)) is a new member of the tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR) family. TR6 mRNA is expressed in lung tissues and colon adenocarcinoma, SW480. In addition, the expression of TR6 mRNA was shown in the endothelial cell line and induced by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate/ionomycin in Jurkat T leukemia cells. The open reading frame of TR6 encodes 300 amino acids with a 29-residue signal sequence but no transmembrane region. Using histidine-tagged recombinant TR6, we screened soluble forms of TNF-ligand proteins with immunoprecipitation. Here, we demonstrate that TR6 specifically binds two cellular ligands, LIGHT (herpes virus entry mediator (HVEM)-L) and Fas ligand (FasL/CD95L). These bindings were confirmed with HEK 293 EBNA cells transfected with LIGHT cDNA by flow cytometry. TR6 inhibited LIGHT-induced cytotoxicity in HT29 cells. It has been shown that LIGHT triggers apoptosis of various tumor cells including HT29 cells that express both lymphotoxin beta receptor (LTbetaR) and HVEM/TR2 receptors. Our data suggest that TR6 inhibits the interactions of LIGHT with HVEM/TR2 and LTbetaR, thereby suppressing LIGHT- mediated HT29 cell death. Thus, TR6 may play a regulatory role for suppressing in FasL- and LIGHT-mediated cell death.
