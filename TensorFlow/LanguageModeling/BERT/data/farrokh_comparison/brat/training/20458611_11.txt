Protein was isolated by vigorously vortexing protoplasts pellets in 100 mul LUC extraction buffer (100 mM potassium phosphate, 1 mM DTT, pH7.5) for 30 s. After centrifugation (10 min, 13,000g, 4degreesC), the supernatant was pipetted into a new 1.5 ml Eppendorf tube and used for determination of LUC activity and protein concentrations. At room temperature, after adding 100 mul filter-sterilized LUC assay buffer (20 mM tricine, 1.07 mM (MgCO3)4Mg(OH)2 x 5H2O, 2.67 mM MgSO4, 0.1 mM EDTA, 33 mM DTT, 0.27 mM CoA, 0.47 mM D-luciferin, 0.53 mM ATP, pH 7.8) to 10 mul of extract LUC activity was determined by Luminometer Lumat LB9501 with an interval of 10 s. Specific LUC activity is given as relative light units (RLUs) mug protein-1 s-1.
