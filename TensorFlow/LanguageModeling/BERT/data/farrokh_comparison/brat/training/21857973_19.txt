(A-I) Cuticles of dechorionated and devitellinized embryos were prepared to visualize exoskeletons and segmentation phenotypes. The cuticle phenotypes in the original Ten-m mutant stock and odd paired alleles are shown. The new Ten-m N1 allele and rebalanced reference alleles fail to reproduce a pair-rule phenotype. Embryos shown are derived from the original: 5309 (A and D) ; Df(3L)Ten-mAL1 (B and E); and Df(3L)Ten-mAL29 (C and F) stocks. (G) N1, (H) odd paired1, and (I) odd paired2. Embryos are oriented: anterior-left.
