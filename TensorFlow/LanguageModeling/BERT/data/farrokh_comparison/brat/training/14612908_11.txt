DU 145 and Jurkat cells were incubated with 200 ng ml-1 anti-Fas IgM for 4 and 24 h as indicated. The cells were subsequently harvested, washed once in PBS and resuspended in 200 mul Annexin V binding buffer (150 mM NaCl, 18 mM CaCl2, 10 mM HEPES, 5 mM KCl, 1 mM MgCl2). A measure of 1 mug ml-1 FITC-conjugated Annexin V, which binds specifically to external phosphatidyl serine on apoptotic cells, was added to each sample and incubated at room temperature for 5 min. PI (50 mug ml-1) was added immediately prior to reading the samples on the FACScan. Viable cells exclude PI and stain negative on FL-2. Apoptotic cells are labelled with Annexin V and stain positive on FL-1. Analysis was carried out using Cell Quest Software.
