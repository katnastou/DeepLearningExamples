Loss of Trim67 leads to impairments in spatial learning and memory. A, Time (s) for mice to find a hidden platform in the Morris water maze, with a threshold for learning set at a group average of 15 s (dashed line). Trim67-/- mice fail to reach this threshold out to the maximum of 9 d of training and have overall significantly higher latencies to find the platform (*p < 0.05; all trials p = 0.0225). B, Time spent in target and opposite quadrants and number of times crossing the previous platform position in a probe trial following acquisition day 9. Whereas Trim67+/+ mice spent a higher amount of time in the quadrant previously occupied by the platform (*p = 0.0003), Trim67-/- mice failed to show this preference and spent a lower time in the target quadrant than Trim67+/+ mice (#p = 0.0343). C, Subsequent reversal trials demonstrated an increased latency to find the platform in the Trim67-/- cohort compared to Trim67+/+ littermates (*p < 0.05; all trials p = 0.0149). D, In a probe trial following reversal day 7, only Trim67+/+ mice spent more time in the new target quadrant (*p = 0.0335).
