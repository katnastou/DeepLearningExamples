As part of an effort to understand the structure of UTPB, we have determined the crystal structure of the tandem WD domain of Utp21, the first structure of a UTPB component. We further identified a region of Utp18 that mediates the interaction with Utp21. The structure allows us to integrate available crosslinking and interaction data to obtain a better understanding of the organization of UTPB.
