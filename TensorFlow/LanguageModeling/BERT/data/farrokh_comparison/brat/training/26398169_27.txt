A positive effect of TRIM21 concerning the field of oncology could be shown by cell cycle analysis. Within this test a correlation between TRIM21 concentration and a higher amount of resting cells in G0/G1-phase and a decrease of cells in S-phase could be shown. A contrary effect of TRIM21 was predicted by Sabile et al, who described TRIM21 as an essential mediator of ubiquitinylation for phosphorylated p27, a tumor-suppressor which prevents cells from entering S-phase. To examine how TRIM21 is actually expressed in breast tumors throughout different degrees of malignity, corresponding tissue samples were obtained from US Biomax, Inc. and TRIM21 was detected using fluorescence labeled antibodies against TRIM21. The expression levels of TRIM21 do not differ distinctly throughout the different degrees of malignity of the inflamed tissue sample but all of these samples show only around half of the expression levels, compared to native tissue. The results we obtained are, however, more consistent with the fact that TRIM21 inhibits activation of NF-kappaB, a family of transcription factors which are mainly responsible for the activation and promotion of cell division. That the protein form of TRIM21 can be transported into the cell could be shown by the NF-kappaB array. The inhibiting effect of TRIM21 towards NF-kappaB becomes clear due to the decrease in expression of the analyzed NF-kappaB-regulated genes. A possible mode of regulation of LFG expression by TRIM21 could be achieved by inhibition of NF-kappaB-activation. As the expression of LFG is regulated partly by NF-kappaB, its inhibition by TRIM21, as shown by Niida et al, could follow the schema displayed in. The reduced activity of NF-kappaB would therefore result in a reduced expression of LFG. This hypothesis however, does not involve an interaction between the two proteins.
