We found that KLHL12 can differentially interact with KHSRP and promote KHSRP ubiquitination. We then sought to elucidate how KLHL12-mediated KHSRP ubiquitination affects IRES-driven translation. This led us to identify a hitherto undescribed regulatory mechanism of IRES-driven translation involving ubiquitination--namely, the regulation of IRES-dependent translation via ubiquitin modulation of ITAFs. Our findings are expected to have important implications for future research regarding viral-host interactions, and may also help to identify novel drug targets for anti-viral therapies.
