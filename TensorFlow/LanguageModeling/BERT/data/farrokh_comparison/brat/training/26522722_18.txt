According to the analysis of ccRCC patient data obtained from TCGA, lower Arkadia expression correlated with advanced cancer stage, but Arkadia was expressed in all ccRCC tumors (Figure 5h), in agreement with the findings that Arkadia suppresses ccRCC tumor proliferation. To determine whether Arkadia functions as a tumor suppressor in ccRCC, we performed a Kaplan-Meier survival analysis using the RNA-seq data and clinical data obtained from TCGA. Although Arkadia mRNA expression did not correlate with ESRP2 mRNA expression (Supplementary Figure S9), higher expression of Arkadia mRNA correlated with better patient prognosis (Figure 5i). Taken together, these findings suggest that the splicing function of ESRP2 promoted by Arkadia results in tumor suppression and a better outcome for ccRCC patients.
