To further evaluate the role of Nek7 at telomeres, we first disrupted telomeric structure by knocking down (KD) the shelterin protein TRF2, but we did not observe Nek7 recruitment at telomeres under this condition (Figure S1D). Second, we introduced telomeric DNA injury by using Flag-TRF1-Fok1 endonuclease to cut telomeres specifically or by treating cells with low and high levels of the DNA polymerase inhibitor aphidicolin, which could induce fragile telomeres, an indicator of replication folk stall. Interestingly, under both conditions, Nek7 was not recruited to the damaged telomere sites (Figures S1E and S1F). Thus, the recruitment of Nek7 is likely restricted to oxidative telomeric DNA damage.
