HEK-293, HT-22 cells and N2A cells were grown in a humid atmosphere of 5% CO2 at 37degreesC in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, L-glutamine (2mM), penicillin (100units/ml), and streptomycin (100 microg/ml). Primary astrocytes were grown in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, L-glutamine (2 mM), penicillin (100 units/ml), streptomycin (100 microg/ml) and sodium pyruvate (1 mM). Primary astrocytes were prepared from mouse cortex as described. The purity of the culture was assessed by immunofluorescence using GFAP as an astrocyte marker and 85-95% of the cells are GFAP positive. Dissociated cortical neurons were prepared from E18 mice as described. HEK-293 cells were transfected with polyfect (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) and HT-22 and N2A cells were transfected with lipofectamine (Invitrogen, Grand Island, NY).
