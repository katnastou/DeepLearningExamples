Emi1 and Emi2 also exhibit DB-independent inhibitory activities against the polyubiquitylation of the APC/C target proteins. The inhibitory activity of Emi1 requires its C-terminal region, which corresponds to the C-terminal tail of Emi2. The ZBR-RL fragment of Emi1 has inhibitory activity against polyubiquitin chain formation on the target protein by APC/C-Cdh1, in combination with E2C/UBE2C/UBCH10 (ubiquitin chain-initiating E2) and/or E2S/UBE2S (ubiquitin chain-extending E2). The C-terminal tails of Emi1 and Emi2 bind to APC/C, and the RL residues compete with the tail of E2S for APC/C binding.
