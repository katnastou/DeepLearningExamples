Further to an interactomic screen carried out by Bergiers et al. to identify Hoxa2 partner proteins, the Hoxa2 protein from the mouse was shown to interact with the human RCHY1 and to induce its destabilization. To confirm these data obtained with proteins of heterologous origin, we addressed whether this destabilization process was conserved for the human proteins. To this end, we transiently transfected HEK293T cells to express human FLAG-RCHY1 and GST or human GST-HOXA2 fusion proteins. As shown in Fig 1A, the level of RCHY1 was considerably decreased in the presence of HOXA2 supporting that, like for the murine Hoxa2, expression of the human HOXA2 had a negative effect on RCHY1 protein accumulation.
