Earlier studies have identified typically one or two spontaneous TIFs in senescent interphase nuclei, which seems inconsistent with our calculation of 4-5 G1-TIFs per senescent cell. When we stained interphase senescent cells, we also commonly found one or two large gamma-H2AX foci per nucleus that colocalized with the DDR proteins MRE11 and NBS1 (Fig 3A). However, deconvolved images showed that 71.2+/-1.3% of senescent nuclei (mean+/-s.d., n=3 experiments, each examining 25 nuclei) had multiple telomeres colocalized within individual gamma-H2AX foci, suggesting that dysfunctional telomeres aggregate in senescent cells (Fig 3B). To test this further, we measured the mean telomeric fluorescence intensity in gamma-H2AX foci of 11 senescent nuclei and compared this with that of the 10 brightest and 10 faintest telomere signals in the same nuclei. The telomeric signal within the gamma-H2AX focus was always brighter than the faintest telomeres and often brighter than the brightest individual telomeres within the cell, consistent with the conclusion that a single gamma-H2AX focus might contain aggregates of dysfunctional telomeres (Fig 3C).
