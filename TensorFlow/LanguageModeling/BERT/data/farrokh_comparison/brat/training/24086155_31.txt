Three overlapping AbG sets were defined to include AbGs-5 kb, -1 kb and -0.5 kb, which consist of genes with at least one Ago1 peak within +/-5, +/-1, and +/-0.5 kb away from TSSs, respectively. AbGs-5 kb, -1 kb and -0.5 kb respectively contain 15503, 10074, and 8057 unique genes encompassing 27.5%, 17.9%, and 14.3% of all annotated genes in Ensembl human genome database (Table S10, S11, S12). Interestingly, clustering AbGs-5 kb, -1 kb or -0.5 kb genes by their chromosomal location reveal several cytobands implicated in different human cancers that are highly overrepresented (Figure S9, Table S13, S14). For example, the top-enriched cytobands 19p13.3 and 16p13.3 have been established by numerous studies to be susceptibility loci for several types of cancers including prostate, breast, thyroid, and lymphoma.
