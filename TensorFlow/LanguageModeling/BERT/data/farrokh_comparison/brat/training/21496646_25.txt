To avoid the lethality of Thorase KO mice, Thorase flox/+ mice were crossed with CaMKIIa-iCre transgenic mice to restrict the temporal and spatial deletion of Thorase to the adult forebrain. Immunoblot analysis and immunohistochemistry verifies that Thorase is largely eliminated from forebrain structures including the hippocampus and cortex but not in other regions such as the cerebellum (Figure S5). There are no gross anatomical changes in the hippocampus or other forebrain structures in the conditional Thorase KO (cKO) mice compared to WT control (Figure S5).
