The limited degree of flexibility seen in exomer stands in contrast to the dichotomy between rigid structures and complete flexibility seen in other cargo adaptors. The Sec23/24 COPII cargo adaptor forms a seemingly rigid "pre-budding complex" with its cognate GTPase Sar1. The clathrin adaptor AP complexes, while exhibiting a significant conformational rearrangement upon membrane and cargo binding, appear to exist in a single, stable conformation when membrane bound. We note that both Sec23/Sec24 and the AP complexes bind to vesicle cage and accessory proteins via flexible linkers. Exomer, however, employs a hinge domain as a primary source of flexibility, implying that constrained flexibility, rather than the complete conformational freedom allowed by a flexible linker, is critical for its function at the TGN.
