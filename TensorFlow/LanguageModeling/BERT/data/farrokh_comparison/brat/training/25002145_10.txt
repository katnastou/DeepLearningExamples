Previous studies showed that ROS1 is required to prevent the transcriptional silencing of RD29A-LUC and 35S-NPTII trans-genes. Mutations in IDM1 cause the silencing of 35S-NPTII but not of the RD29A-LUC transgene. An independent genetic screen for mutants impaired in the prevention of silencing of the 35S-SUC2 transgene led to the isolation of mutant alleles of IDM1 as well as ROS1. This later genetic screen also led to the isolation of idm2-3(Figure 1C). Wild-type 35S-SUC2 trans-genic plants showed an inhibition of root growth on Murashige-Skoog (MS) medium with 2% sucrose due to high levels of SUC2 (sucrose transporter 2) expression. The root length in both idm1-9 and idm2-3 plants was similar to that in the Col-0 control that did not have the 35S-SUC2 transgene. Both the 35S-SUC2 and 35S-HPTII transgenes were silenced in idm1-9 and idm2-3 mutant plants (Figure 1D). Bisulfite sequencing analysis showed that, compared to the wild-type control, the DNA methylation level of the 35S promoter region was increased in idm1-9 and idm2-3 plants (Figure S1E). The At1g26400 region was also hypermethylated in idm1-9 and idm2-3 according to the Chop PCR results (Figure S1F). Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays showed an increased H3K9me2 level and a decreased H3K4me2 level in the 35S promoter region in the mutant plants (Figure 1E). In idm2-3, a single-nucleotide-substitution mutation (from GGG to GAG) in At1g54840 changed amino acid glycine 276 to glutamic acid. Consistent with the genetic mapping result (Figure S1G) suggesting that the idm2-3 mutation was responsible for the long-root phenotype, all of the F1 plants from genetic crosses between idm2-3 and idm2-1 (SALK_130656) had a long-root phenotype like that of idm2-3 (Figure S1H). We also transferred the wild-type IDM2 genomic fragment into idm2-3 mutant plants and found that it can complement the root phenotype (Figure S1H). These results demonstrated that, like IDM1 and ROS1, IDM2 is required for prevention of transcriptional silencing of the 35-SUC2 and 35S-HPTII transgenes.
