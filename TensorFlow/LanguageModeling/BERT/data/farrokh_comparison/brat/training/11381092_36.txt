We have identified Mba1 as one such other component that is in contact with insertion intermediates as they integrate into the lipid bilayer. Like Oxa1, Mba1 is required for efficient protein insertion of both mitochondrially and nuclear-encoded proteins. Mba1 and Oxa1 overlap not only in substrate specificity, but most likely also in their function. In the presence of Oxa1, Mba1 is largely dispensable, indicating that Oxa1 can function independently of Mba1. In contrast, Mba1 is unable to replace Oxa1 completely even upon overexpression, but restores the defective insertion of the Oxa1 precursor in a Deltaoxa1 mutant. This partial suppression may be explained by the observation that Mba1 needs Oxa1 to interact with Cox2, whereas its interaction with Cox3 is independent of Oxa1.
