For tubulin, we created an S. pombe strain mmsp174 (h- ura4.d18 arg3.D4 atb2-::nda2+) containing only alpha1- and beta-tubulin protein isoforms by replacing the atb2 (alpha2) gene protein-encoding region with the protein-coding region of the alpha1 gene nda2 using a DNA fragment that was PCR-amplified from genomic DNA using a previously described method. Single isoform S. pombe alpha1- and beta-tubulin was prepared by a modification of a previously described method to be described in detail elsewhere. Purified tubulins were desalted into K-PEM buffer (100 mM PIPES, 1 mM MgSO4 and 2 mM EGTA adjusted to pH 6.9 with KOH) containing 20 muM GDP before storage in liquid nitrogen. Protein concentrations were determined by UV-absorption scan of protein samples dissolved in 6 M guanidine hydrochloride, assuming full nucleotide occupancy and epsilon of 108,390 M-1 cm-1.
