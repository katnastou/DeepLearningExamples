We analyzed the mitotic defects of the ensc mutants in detail by fully depolymerizing mitotic spindles from WT and ensc Nbs by cold treatment and monitoring Mt regrowth at 25degreesC (Fig. 3 A). In control tests, we observed large centrosomal asters 30 s after the return to 25degreesC conditions (Fig. 3 B, left, red arrows; n = 19). We also detected asters around the main chromosome mass and discrete Kt fibers (Fig. 3 B, white arrows). At 90 s, the WT spindles had a normal, bipolar shape (n = 25). The ensc mutant Nbs displayed weak aster formation around the chromosomes and no obvious Kt fibers after 30 s (n > 30; Fig. 3 B, right). After 90 s, only short spindles with weak, disorganized Mt arrays were present (n = 24). Overall, our results suggest that Ensconsin contributes to the polymerization of spindle Mts. For confirmation of this role, we quantified Mt growth directly by tracking EB1-GFP comets at Mt plus ends in WT and ensc Nbs (Fig. 3 C and Video 8). Measurements of Mt dynamic parameters revealed that the mean rate of Mt polymerization was significantly lower (reduced by 12%) in the ensc mutant than in WT Nbs (Fig. 3 D), a difference sufficient to account for the short spindles observed in ensc mutants.
