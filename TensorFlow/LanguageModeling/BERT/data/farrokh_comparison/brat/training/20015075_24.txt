Collagen-related peptides (GPO)10, GCO-(GPO)10-GCOG-NH2 that recognizes collagen binding site for GPVI, and the GFOGER peptide, GPC(GPP)5GFOGER(GPP)5GPC that recognizes the integrin alpha2beta1 binding site were synthesized by Synbiosci Co. (Livermore, CA). The RGQOGVMGF peptide, GPC-(GPP)5-GPOGPSGPRGQOGVMGFOGPKGNDGAO-(GPP)5-GPC-NH2 that recognizes the vWF binding site in collagen was synthesized by Biosynthesis, Inc. (Lewisville, TX). RGQOGVMGF peptide was also obtained without hydroxyproline and referred as RGQPGVMGF peptide. For some control experiments RGQPGVMGF peptide was scrambled (http://users.umassmed.edu) and the resulting peptide PGGPDGGF(P)10GPGGKPPNGQGPPSPPGPAGGPGPGMPPGPPGGVPGCGGPGRPPC-NH2 synthesized by Biosynthesis Inc (Lewisville, TX)(Supplemental data, Figure S3E). All peptides were purified by HPLC and the molecular mass estimated by mass spectrometry: (GPO)10 (mass spectrum, 3294.7 da; theoretical, 3293.6 da); GFOGER (mass spectrum, 3705.3 da; theoretical, 3704.2 da); RGQOGVMGF (mass spectrum, 5573.2 da; theoretical, 5571.27 da) and scrambled RGQPGVMGF (mass spectrum, 5511.36; theoretical 5511.3 da). For cross-linking, the peptides were re-suspended in PBS and incubated at 4degreesC for 48 hours, or incubated with SPDP (N-succinimimidyl-3-[2-Pyridyldithiol] propionate) reagent from Pierce Co. (Rockford, IL), as described. Control experiments show that RGQOGVMGF supports vWF binding (Figure 3F), (GPO)10 induces platelet aggregation (Figure 4C), and GFOGER supports platelet adhesion in a Ca2+-dependent manner (Figure 4D), indicating that all peptides were biologically active according to appropriate in vitro assays.
