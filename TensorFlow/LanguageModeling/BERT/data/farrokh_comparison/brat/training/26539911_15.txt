Although CD133 is a putative marker for CSCs in many distinct solid tumor types and is associated with aggressive cancers and poor prognosis, the precise function of CD133 in tumor formation remained unknown. We first examined whether CD133 expression is essential for NTERA2 tumor cell growth by measuring bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) incorporation in cells transfected with CD133 siRNA (Figure 5a). Twenty-six percent of the CD133 knockdown cells were BrdU positive while 70% of the control cells were BrdU positive (Figure 5b); these data were corroborated in NCCIT cells (Supplementary Figure 5a).
