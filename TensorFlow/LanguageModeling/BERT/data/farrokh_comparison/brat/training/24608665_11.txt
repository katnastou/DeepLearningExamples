MCF7 cells were grown in 10 cm plates to 40% confluency and transfected (Roche Xtreme Gene 9) with HA-DBC2 or pcDNA3-empty vector for 16 hours. Cells were washed twice with cold PBS supplemented with 20 mM sodium molybdate and then lysed with HNET buffer (20 mM Hepes pH 7.7 with KOH, 100 mM NaCl, 2 mM EGTA, 0.5% NP-40, 5% glycerol, 20 mM sodium molybdate and Roche protease inhibitor cocktail). Lysates were centrifuged at maximum speed in a bench top centrifuge at 4degreesC for 15 minutes. Supernatants were then added to 40 microl of anti-HA beads (Sigma-Aldrich, A2095) and mixed at 4degreesC for 3 hours. Following washing of the pull-down beads 3 times with HNET buffer, adsorbed proteins were eluted with sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) sample buffer. Samples were subsequently analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting for Hsp90 [OSUb2, ] and HA (Covance, MMS-101P)].
