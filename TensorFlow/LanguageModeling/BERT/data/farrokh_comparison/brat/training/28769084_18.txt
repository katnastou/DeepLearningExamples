Endocytosis of FGF1-FGFR1 complexes is mediated by clathrin and dynamin. To study whether scFvD2-Fc utilizes the same molecular machinery as FGF1 for its delivery into the cellular interior, we employed specific inhibitors of clathrin (Pitstop2) and dynamin (Dynasore). We observed that the internalization of scFvD2-Fc, similarly to the internalization of FGF1, was partially blocked by the presence of Pitstop2 and Dynasore (Fig. 5). These data suggest that even though internalization of scFvD2-Fc occurs without FGFR1 activation, it follows the same dynamin/clathrin dependent pathways as FGF1.
