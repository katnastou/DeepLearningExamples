Given that GLR-1::GFP levels decrease in both the VNC and in interneuron cell bodies of usp-46 mutants, we tested whether USP-46 affects transcription of glr-1. If USP-46 controls GLR-1::GFP abundance by regulating glr-1 transcription, we would expect glr-1 transcript levels to be decreased in usp-46 mutants. We performed real-time PCR analysis of total mRNA isolated from wild type and usp-46 mutant animals and quantified the ratio of glr-1 to act-1 (actin) mRNA. We observed a 2.6-fold increase in glr-1 mRNA in usp-46 mutants (Fig. 2B), indicating that the decrease in GLR-1::GFP in the VNCs of these animals is not due to a decrease in glr-1 transcription. The increase in glr-1 transcription is suggestive of a potential negative feedback loop in which decreased GLR-1 at synapses in usp-46 loss-of-function animals leads to increased transcription of the receptor, however further experiments will be necessary to test this hypothesis. This putative transcriptional compensation suggests that we may underestimate the decrease in GLR-1 protein abundance in usp-46 mutants.
