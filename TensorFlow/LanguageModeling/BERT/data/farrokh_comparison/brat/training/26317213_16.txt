(A) Hydrolysis of N-succinyl-ala-ala-pro-phe-p-nitroanilidine (peptidyl prolyl cis-trans isomerase or PPIase activity) in the presence of 4.34 nM of recombinant AtCyp19-3 and 52.4 nM and 65.87 nM each of AtCyp19-3(35-176) and AtCyp19-3(71-176) proteins. The rate of reaction is expressed as first order rate constant (k) Bovine serum albumin (BSA) was used as a negative control. (B) Effect of purified AtCyp19-3 on rate constant. (C) Effect of cyclophilin inhibitor, cyclosporin A (CsA), and FKBP inhibitor, FK506, on the PPIase activity of AtCyp19-3 (D) Determination of inhibition constant (ki) of AtCyp19-3 for CsA. Inhibition constant (ki) for CsA was determined as gradient of the line of the best fit from a plot of [CsA]/(1-k/ko) against ko/k, where k is the rate constant at any given CsA concentration and ko is the rate constant in the absence of CsA. The slope of the line represents the ki.
