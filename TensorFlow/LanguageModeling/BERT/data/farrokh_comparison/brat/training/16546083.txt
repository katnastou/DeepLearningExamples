ATR homolog Mec1 controls association of DNA polymerase zeta-Rev1 complex with regions near a double-strand break. 
DNA polymerase zeta (Polzeta) and Rev1 contribute to the bypassing of DNA lesions, termed translesion DNA synthesis (TLS). Polzeta consists of two subunits, one encoded by REV3 (the catalytic subunit) and the other encoded by REV7. Rev1 acts as a deoxycytidyl transferase, inserting dCMP opposite lesions. Polzeta and Rev1 have been shown to operate in the same TLS pathway in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Here, we show that budding yeast Polzeta and Rev1 form a complex and associate together with double-strand breaks (DSBs). As a component of the Polzeta-Rev1 complex, Rev1 plays a noncatalytic role in the association with DSBs. In budding yeast, the ATR-homolog Mec1 plays a central role in the DNA-damage checkpoint response. We further show that Mec1-dependent phosphorylation promotes the Polzeta-Rev1 association with DSBs. Rev1 association with DSBs requires neither the function of the Rad24 checkpoint-clamp loader nor the Rad6-Rad18-mediated ubiquitination of PCNA. Our results reveal a novel role of Mec1 in the localization of the Polzeta-Rev1 complex to DNA lesions and highlight a linkage of TLS polymerases to the checkpoint response.
