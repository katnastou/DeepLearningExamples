At the molecular level, some Hoxa2 transcriptional targets such as Lmo1, Meox1, Lhx6, Ptx1, Robo2 or Six2 have been reported. However, only Six2, Robo2 and Hoxa2 itself, have been characterized so far as direct Hoxa2 target genes. A genome-wide survey of Hoxa2-bound sequences in the second branchial arch correlated to transcriptomic analyses allowed identifying large sets of candidate genes under the immediate control of Hoxa2. As interaction partners, only TALE proteins could be directly related to Hoxa2 molecular function and a few candidate Hoxa2-interacting proteins have been identified mainly in the context of high-throughput experiments.
