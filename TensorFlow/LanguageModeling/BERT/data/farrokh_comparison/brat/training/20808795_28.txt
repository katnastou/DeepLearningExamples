Similarly, the different Galpha-subunits possess a similar affinity towards the interaction with the Gbetagamma heterodimer, not providing an explanation for a specific ability of Galphao to antagonize the Gs-mediated post-eclosion pathway. We are thus tempted to propose that a previously uncharacterized biochemical mechanism may allow for a specific antagonism physiologically existing between the Gs- and Go- mediated signaling pathways. As liberation of high amounts of GDP-loaded Galphao is predicted to be a consequence of activation of multiple Go-coupled GPCRs, and as Go is a heavily expressed G protein representing the major G protein species e.g. in the brain of flies and mammals, this specific ability of Galphao to antagonize the Gs-mediated signaling may have physiological implications in other tissues and organisms than Drosophila wing. However, we would like to add that these speculations are based on the analysis of the overexpression data and must be treated with caution when translating them into physiological situations.
