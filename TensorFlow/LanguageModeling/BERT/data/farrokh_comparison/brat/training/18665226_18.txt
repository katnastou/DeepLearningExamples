Given the the in vitro interactions of Rbf1N with ORC and colocalization of Rbf1N and Orc2, we hypothesized that the Rbf1N domain may function to regulate cell cycle progression in general and DNA replication in particular. To test this hypothesis we overexpressed the Rbf1N protein in tissues of transgenic Drosophila. First, actin>GAL4 driving expression of the UAS>Rbf1N-RFP was examined in the ovarian follicle cells. We observed robust expression and nuclear localization of the Rbf1N-RFP in follicle cells, however BrdU labeling of follicle cells did not reveal any detectable changes in DNA replication patterns during endoreplication or chorion gene amplification (data not shown). Flow cytometry analysis of follicle cell nuclei also did not reveal any significant differences in ploidy content (Table S1), proportion of follicle cells in S phase (Table S2) or nuclear size (Table S3) versus controls. In addition, overexpression of Rbf1N-RFP in diploid proliferating neuroblasts similarly did not cause any cell cycle pertubation, as assayed by flow cytometry (data not shown). Lastly, overexpression of different independent insertion lines of UAS>Rbf1N-RFP in the developing eye by GMR>GAL4 or ey>GAL4 did not yield any obvious adult eye phenotypes (data not shown). These data suggest that although Rbf1N is sufficient for chromatin localization and its interaction with Orc2, the Rbf1N (1-345) domain alone is not sufficient for significantly altering the cell cycle in vivo.
