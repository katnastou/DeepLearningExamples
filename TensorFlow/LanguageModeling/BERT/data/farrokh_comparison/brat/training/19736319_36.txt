Fission yeast strains used in this study are listed in Table S1. Strains not created in this study were provided by J. Jimenez (Centro Andaluz de Biologia del Desarrollo, Sevilla, Spain) and M. Balasubramanian (The National University of Singapore, Singapore, Republic of Singapore). Genetic crosses and general yeast techniques were performed as described previously. S. pombe strains were grown in rich medium (yeast extract [YE]) or Edinburgh minimal medium (EMM) with appropriate supplements. EMM with 5 microg/ml thiamine or YE was used to repress expression from the nmt1 promoter. For expression of GFP-Etd1, cells were grown for 2 d in EMM solid without thiamine at 25degreesC and then grown in EMM liquid without thiamine for an additional 20 h. YE containing 100 mg Geneticin (G-418; Sigma-Aldrich) per liter was used for selecting KanR cells. For serial dilution drop tests for growth, four serial 10-fold dilutions were made, and 5 microl of each dilution was spotted on plates with the starting cell number of 104. Cells were grown in liquid YE or EMM at 25degreesC and then spotted onto YE or EMM plates at the indicated temperatures and incubated for 3-5 d before photography. All strains with an etd1Delta genotype were built by genetic crosses with the strain DM3547. After tetrad dissection, the YE plates containing single spores were incubated at 36degreesC, and the final ura+ clones were screened for the etd1Delta phenotype at 25degreesC and for the absence or presence of the plasmid-containing etd1+ gene through the leucine marker. GFP fluorescence or G-418 resistance was used to screen for other markers in the strains of interest. For treatment with MBC (Sigma-Aldrich), log-phase cells were treated for 10 min with MBC used at the final concentration of 25 microg/ml from a 10 mg/ml stock and then centrifuged in a microfuge (model 5415C; Eppendorf) to concentrate the cells and imaged in the presence of 25 microg/ml MBC.
