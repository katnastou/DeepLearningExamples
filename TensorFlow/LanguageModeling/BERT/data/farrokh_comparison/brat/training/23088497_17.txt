To analyze the generated GFP-WIPI-1 mutants in their ability to bind PtdIns(3)P and PtdIns(3,5)P2, we first confirmed that over-expressed wild-type GFP-WIPI-1 in different cell lines that either express detectable (G361) or undetectable (HeLa, U2OS) levels of endogenous WIPI-1 protein (Figure 6A), predominantly binds PtdIns(3)P and to a minor extend PtdIns(3,5)P2 (Figure 6B and 6C upper panel). As expected, the RR mutant (R226A/R227A) did not bind to either of the phospholipids (Figure 6C lower panel).
