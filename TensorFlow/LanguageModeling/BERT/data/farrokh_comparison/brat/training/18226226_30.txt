Our study on the growth-promoting function of bunA in Drosophila may influence the perspective on the mammalian homologs of Bun, especially on TSC-22 (TSC22D1). Whereas the longer isoform of TSC-22 (TSC22D1.1) is similar to BunA (and BunF), the shorter isoform (TSC22D1.2) resembles BunB, BunD, and BunE. Data from numerous studies suggest that TSC22D1.2 acts as a tumor suppressor, which is at odds with the fact that only bunA is involved in growth regulation in Drosophila, and that BunA behaves rather opposite to a tumor suppressor. The results from our in vivo analysis may be of special interest in this context, since the relative balance of bun transcripts is important (allelic series) and overexpression of bunC (and also bunB) interferes with bunA function in a dominant negative manner. If this interaction is conserved in mammals, we can envision the following scenario for how the TSC-22 locus may be involved in tumor suppression. Whereas the long TSC-22 isoform, TSC22D1.1, positively regulates cellular growth (as does BunA), the short isoform, TSC22D1.2, inhibits growth by competing with TSC22D1.1. The antagonism between the long and the short isoforms can be achieved at several levels. An excess of the short isoform could lead to the formation of non-functional heterodimers, or the two isoforms could compete for another dimerization partner. Provided that TSC-22 functions in transcriptional regulation, the two isoforms might also contribute to differential regulation of target genes. In either case, the long TSC-22 isoform could be hyperactivated as a consequence of the loss of the short isoform. Thus, the short isoform could act as a tumor suppressor by keeping the long isoform in check. Our findings should encourage further studies in mammals that distinguish between the TSC-22 isoforms and that primarily focus on the function of the long TSC-22 protein, TSC22D1.1.
