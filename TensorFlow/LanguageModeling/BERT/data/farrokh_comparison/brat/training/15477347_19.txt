To confirm this observation in primary T cells, retroviral gene transfer was used to infect activated CD4 positive lymph node/spleen cells from transgenic DO11.10 mice. T cells from this mouse expresses a TCR for chicken OVA peptide (residues 323-339), which can be presented by A20 cells. Retroviral gene transfer resulted in expression of GFP, ADAP-GFP, or M12-GFP in 18-27% of cells (Fig. 2 e). Conjugation was assessed by FACS analysis for the binding of GFP-expressing cells with PKH26 labeled A20 cells. Exposure to OVA peptide increased conjugation by two- to threefold relative to vector GFP control cells (i.e., 2-3 to 7-8%; Fig. 2 c). Infection with ADAP-GFP further increased conjugation with a two- to threefold shift in binding to APCs (i.e., 7-8 to 20%). In contrast, as noted with the T8.1 cells, the expression of GFP-M12 failed to increase conjugation. These findings indicate that ADAP can enhance conjugate formation of primary murine T cells in a manner analogous to the T8.1 system, and that the loss of the SLP-76 binding sites abrogates this effect.
