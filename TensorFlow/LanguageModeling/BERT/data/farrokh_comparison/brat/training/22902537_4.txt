We are particularly interested in understanding how proteins with well-known roles for RNA processing contribute to maintaining telomere integrity. Mammalian heterogeneous ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) A1 regulates splicing and exports mRNA (reviewed in), and several studies have shown its role in telomere maintenance. Deletion in hnRNP A1 causes significantly short telomeres. hnRNP A1 also interacts with telomeric DNA and telomerase as well as stimulates telomerase-dependent telomere maintenance in vivo. hnRNP A1 likely has protective roles at the telomeres.
