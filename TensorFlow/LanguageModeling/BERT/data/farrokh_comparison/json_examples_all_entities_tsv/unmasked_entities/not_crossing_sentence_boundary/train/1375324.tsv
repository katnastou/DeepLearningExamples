1375324,s2,T4,T5,Here we demonstrate complete correlation between the expression pattern of the ,CD19, gene and the B-cell-specific transcription factor ,BSAP, in a large panel of B-lymphoid cell lines.,Not_a_complex
1375324,s3,T6,T7,The human ,CD19," gene has been cloned, and several ",BSAP,-binding sites have been mapped by in vitro protein-DNA binding studies.,Not_a_complex
1375324,s5,T9,T10,"Moreover, this site is occupied by ",BSAP, in vivo in a ,CD19,-expressing B-cell line but not in plasma or HeLa cells.,Not_a_complex
1375324,s6,T11,T12,This high-affinity site has been conserved in the promoters of both human and mouse ,CD19, genes and was furthermore shown to confer B-cell specificity to a ,beta-globin reporter, gene in transient transfection experiments.,Not_a_complex
1375324,s7,T13,T14,"In addition, ",BSAP, was found to be the only abundant DNA-binding activity of B-cell nuclear extracts that interacts with the ,CD19, promoter.,Not_a_complex
1375324,s8,T15,T16,"Together, this evidence strongly implicates ",BSAP, in the regulation of the ,CD19, gene.,Not_a_complex
