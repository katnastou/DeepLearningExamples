19665973,s4,T1,T4,Here we describe the crystal structure of the activated tyrosine kinase domain of ,FGFR1, in complex with a ,phospholipase Cgamma, fragment.,Complex_formation
19665973,s5,T5,T2,The structural and biochemical data and experiments with cultured cells show that the selectivity of ,phospholipase Cgamma, binding and signaling via activated ,FGFR1, are determined by interactions between a secondary binding site on an SH2 domain and a region in FGFR1 kinase domain in a phosphorylation independent manner.,Complex_formation
