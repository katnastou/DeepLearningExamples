20861300_28,s1,T4,T5,"However, during these analyses we additionally observed that ",Rbf1," (6KA), harboring substitutions of all lysine residues within the IE was reproducibly a more potent repressor than ",Rbf1," (4KA), harboring substitutions of only the four most N-terminal lysine residues within the IE.",Not_a_complex
20861300_28,s2,T6,T7,This observation raised the possibility that while most of the lysines play a positive role in ,Rbf1," repression, one or both of the C-terminal-most lysine residues (K774, K782) play a negative role, restricting ",Rbf1, activity.,Not_a_complex
20861300_28,s3,T8,T9,"Therefore, to determine whether the lysine residues within the IE contribute to both positive and negative regulation of ",Rbf1," function, we tested the repression activities of ",Rbf1, proteins with individual alanine substitutions of each lysine residue within the IE.,Not_a_complex
