9111040,s1,T4,T5,Truncated forms of the ,NOTCH1, transmembrane receptor engineered to resemble mutant forms of ,NOTCH1, found in certain cases of human T cell leukemia/lymphoma (T-ALL) efficiently induce T-ALL when expressed in the bone marrow of mice.,Not_a_complex
9111040,s2,T6,T7,Unlike full-sized ,NOTCH1,", two such truncated forms of the protein either lacking a major portion of the extracellular domain (DeltaE) or consisting only of the intracellular domain (ICN) were found to activate transcription in cultured cells, presumably through ",RBP-Jkappa, response elements within DNA.,Not_a_complex
9111040,s4,T9,T10,Transcriptional activation required the presence of a weak ,RBP-Jkappa,-binding site within the ,NOTCH1, ankyrin repeat region of the intracellular domain.,Complex_formation
