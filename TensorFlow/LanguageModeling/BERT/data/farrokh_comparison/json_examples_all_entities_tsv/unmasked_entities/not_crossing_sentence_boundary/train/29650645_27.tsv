29650645_27,s1,T1,T4,We propose that the mitoCPR effector ,Cis1, recruits ,Msp1, to the outer membrane translocase to clear stalled proteins from the translocase thereby improving mitochondrial import (Fig. 7F).,Complex_formation
29650645_27,s4,T5,T2,Whether the ,Msp1,-,Cis1, complex can clear preproteins from ribosomes during co-translational import or whether the complex only recognizes post-translationally imported proteins remains to be determined.,Complex_formation
29650645_27,s5,T3,T6,We also do not yet know whether ,Cis1, and ,Msp1, improve mitochondrial import solely by clearing un-imported proteins.,Not_a_complex
