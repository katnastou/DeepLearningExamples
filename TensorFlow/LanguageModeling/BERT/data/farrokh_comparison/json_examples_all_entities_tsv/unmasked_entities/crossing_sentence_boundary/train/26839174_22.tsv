Deletion of MMR1 in a wild-type background results in two populations of yeast cells. One population exhibits extended RLS and has mitochondria that are higher functioning compared with those observed in wild-type cells. The other population ages prematurely and has lower-functioning mitochondria. We find that there is no short-lived population of mfb1Delta mmr1Delta cells. Moreover, we find that double-mutant cells exhibit an RLS that is longer than that of mfb1Delta cells (Fig. 4e). Thus, deletion of MFB1 extends RLS in mmr1Delta cells and vice versa. Deletion of MMR1 in mfb1Delta cells also rescued cellular growth rates (Fig. 4f). Overall, these results indicate that Mfb1p and Mmr1p have antagonistic effects in controlling mitochondrial partitioning, and that the disproportionate loss of mitochondria from mother cells is the primary cause for cellular growth defects and premature ageing in mfb1Delta cells.
