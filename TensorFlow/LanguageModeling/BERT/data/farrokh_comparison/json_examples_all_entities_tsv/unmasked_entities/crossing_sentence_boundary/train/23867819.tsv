Loss-of-function mutation of the PTEN-induced kinase 1 (PINK1) gene is a common cause of early-onset Parkinson's disease (PD). Glutathione S-transferase omega (GSTO) is a phase II detoxification enzyme that conjugates targets to glutathione, and has recently been implicated in parkin-associated PD. In this study, we found Drosophila GstO2 to be a novel genetic suppressor of the PINK1 loss-of-function mutant. We show that GstO2A expression is reduced in PINK1 mutants. Moreover, the upregulation of GstO2A restores muscle degeneration and dopaminergic neuron loss in PINK1 mutants. Given the previous data of a reduced expression of GstO2A and decreased glutathionylation of ATP synthase beta subunit in parkin or PINK1 mutants, these results suggest that the function of GstO2 is regulated by the PINK1/parkin pathway and that GstO2 also has a protective role in PINK1-associated PD.

Loss-of-function mutation of the PTEN-induced kinase 1 (PINK1) gene is a common cause of early-onset Parkinson's disease (PD). Glutathione S-transferase omega (GSTO) is a phase II detoxification enzyme that conjugates targets to glutathione, and has recently been implicated in parkin-associated PD. In this study, we found Drosophila GstO2 to be a novel genetic suppressor of the PINK1 loss-of-function mutant. We show that GstO2A expression is reduced in PINK1 mutants. Moreover, the upregulation of GstO2A restores muscle degeneration and dopaminergic neuron loss in PINK1 mutants. Given the previous data of a reduced expression of GstO2A and decreased glutathionylation of ATP synthase beta subunit in parkin or ",PINK1," mutants, these results suggest that the function of ",GstO2," is regulated by the PINK1/parkin pathway and that GstO2 also has a protective role in PINK1-associated PD.
