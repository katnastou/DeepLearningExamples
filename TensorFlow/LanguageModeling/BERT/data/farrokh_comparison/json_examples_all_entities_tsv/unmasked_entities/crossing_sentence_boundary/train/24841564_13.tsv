In these mutants, one of the coordinating histidine residues of either the bL (Cytb-H183T) or bH (Cytb-H197F) site was altered, resulting in the loss of the respective heme coordination (Fig. 3 A). Because both heme cofactors are essential for the electron transport processes of the bc1 complex, the individual mutations caused a respiratory-deficient phenotype (Fig. 3 B). Consistently, cells expressing these mutated cytochrome b variants failed to accumulate normal amounts of the bc1 complex, whereas levels of the COX complex were essentially unchanged (Fig. 3 C). We then constructed yeast strains expressing these cytochrome b variants and a His7-tagged Cbp3, prepared mitochondria from these cells, and lysed them in digitonin and purified intermediate I using the His7-tag (Fig. 3, D and E). Next, we determined the heme contents of these complexes via HPLC (Fig. 3 F). Strikingly, the bH mutant exhibited identical amounts of heme bs/cytochrome b protein as intermediate I from mitochondria containing wild-type cytochrome b (Fig. 3, F and G). In contrast, intermediate I from the bL mutant almost completely lacked heme b signals (Fig. 3, F and G). These data therefore confirm that cytochrome b in intermediate I contains only one heme b and reveal that this heme is bound to the intact bL site (Fig. 3 H). Because the bL mutant contained only very little heme b, these results suggest a strict order in hemylation, namely that the bL site must be hemylated before the bH site.

24841564_13,s8,T34,T27,"These results inspired us to test whether one specific heme is incorporated first and hence present in intermediate I. To accomplish this, we created two mitochondrial genomes expressing two different cytochrome b variants. In these mutants, one of the coordinating histidine residues of either the bL (Cytb-H183T) or bH (Cytb-H197F) site was altered, resulting in the loss of the respective heme coordination (Fig. 3 A). Because both heme cofactors are essential for the electron transport processes of the bc1 complex, the individual mutations caused a respiratory-deficient phenotype (Fig. 3 B). Consistently, cells expressing these mutated cytochrome b variants failed to accumulate normal amounts of the bc1 complex, whereas levels of the COX complex were essentially unchanged (Fig. 3 C). We then constructed yeast strains expressing these cytochrome b variants and a His7-tagged Cbp3, prepared mitochondria from these cells, and lysed them in digitonin and purified intermediate I using the His7-tag (Fig. 3, D and E). Next, we determined the heme contents of these complexes via HPLC (Fig. 3 F). Strikingly, the bH mutant exhibited identical amounts of heme bs/cytochrome b protein as intermediate I from mitochondria containing wild-type cytochrome b (Fig. 3, F and G).
