Through their ",ubiquitin ligase," activity, ",Cbl,"-family proteins suppress signalling mediated by protein-tyrosine kinases (PTKs), but can also function as adaptor proteins to positively regulate signalling. The tyrosine kinase binding (TKB) domain of this family is critical for binding with tyrosine-phosphorylated target proteins. Here, we analysed the crystal structure of the TKB domain of Cbl-c/Cbl-3 (Cbl-c TKB), which is a distinct member of the mammalian Cbl-family. In comparison with Cbl TKB, Cbl-c TKB showed restricted structural flexibility upon phosphopeptide binding. A mutation in Cbl-c TKB augmenting this flexibility enhanced its binding to target phosphoproteins. These results suggest that proteins, post-translational modifications or mutations that alter structural flexibility of the TKB domain of Cbl-family proteins could regulate their binding to target phosphoproteins and thereby, affect PTK-mediated signalling.
