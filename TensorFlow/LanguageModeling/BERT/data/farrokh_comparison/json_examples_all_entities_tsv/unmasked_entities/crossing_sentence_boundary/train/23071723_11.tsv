23071723_11,s4,T2,T3,"The principal forms for DNA damage induced by UVB and UVA are cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers and 6,4-pyrimidine-pyrimidone photoproducts, while UVC mostly forms dipyrimidines that contain 5-methylcytosine. These photoproducts are mutagenic and block DNA replication by the replicative DNA polymerases. The swi7-1 mutant cells were only mildly sensitive to UV irradiation (Figure 1A). Cell growth began to decline slightly only when yeast cells were subjected to a 150 J/m2 dose of UV. These results indicate that the ",swi7,-1 mutation affects the ability of ,Pol alpha," to respond to alkylation and HU-induced DNA damage.
