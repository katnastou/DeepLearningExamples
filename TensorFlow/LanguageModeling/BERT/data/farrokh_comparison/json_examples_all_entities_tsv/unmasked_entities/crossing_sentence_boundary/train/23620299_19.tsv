Of the five KEOPS subunits, Kae1 is the sole subunit universally conserved across all three domains of life. Hence, we reasoned that Kae1 contributed an essential core function within KEOPS and that Bud32, Cgi121, Pcc1 and Gon7 evolved to augment or regulate Kae1. Interestingly, eukaryotic cells harbor a Kae1 paralog, Qri7, which is targeted to mitochondria. Consistent with the predicted paralogous relationship, redirection of Qri7 from the mitochondria to the cytoplasm via deletion of the mitochondrial targeting sequence enabled rescue of the slow growth phenotype of a kae1Delta yeast strain.
