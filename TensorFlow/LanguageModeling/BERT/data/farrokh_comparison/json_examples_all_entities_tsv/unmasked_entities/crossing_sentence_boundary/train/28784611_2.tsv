28784611_2,s0,T6,T10,Many eukaryotic cells divide by assembling and constricting an ,actin,- and ,myosin,"-based contractile ring (CR) that is physically linked to the plasma membrane (PM). In this study, we report that <i>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</i> cells lacking <i>efr3</i>, which encodes a conserved PM scaffold for the phosphatidylinositol-4 kinase Stt4, build CRs that can slide away from the cell middle during anaphase in a myosin V-dependent manner. The Efr3-dependent CR-anchoring mechanism is distinct from previously reported pathways dependent on the Fes/CIP4 homology Bin-Amphiphysin-Rvs167 (F-BAR) protein Cdc15 and paxillin Pxl1. In <i>efr3Delta</i>, the concentrations of several membrane-binding proteins were reduced in the CR and/or on the PM. Our results suggest that proper PM lipid composition is important to stabilize the central position of the CR and resist myosin V-based forces to promote the fidelity of cell division.
