23837592_13,s0,T1,T3,IM-MS measurements for the ,ASB9,-,EloBC,"-Cul5NTD protein complex were performed with the Synapt HDMS. N2 gas was used in the ion-mobility cell at 0.5 mbar pressure, whereas the traveling wave velocity was 250 ms-1. To optimize the IM separation for the ASB9-EloBC-Cul5NTD complex, measurements were taken at six wave heights (7.0, 7.5, 8.0, 8.5, 9.0, and 9.5 V). The reported collision cross section (CCS) values are an average of the data recorded over all of the wave heights. The CCS calibration procedure used was described previously and involved validation through the use of CCS data from other known protein ions. The drift times for all charge states were obtained using MassLynx and DriftScope (Waters).
