ABP-280 did not bind to the His-tagged peptide encoded by the vector polylinker sequence, but ABP-280 was detected in precipitates with wild type cytoplasmic domain of TF. Precipitation appeared to be enhanced with constructs that encoded Asp substitutions for each of the cytoplasmic Ser residues to mimic phosphorylation. Ala replacement for Ser253 and Ser258 essentially abolished binding of ABP-280 in the precipitation experiment, consistent with the suggested diminished affinity for the mutant in the two-hybrid assay. Taken together, these data indicate that Ser phosphorylation of the TF cytoplasmic domain can modulate affinity for ABP-280.
