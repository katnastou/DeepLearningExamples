Interleukin-7 (IL-7) receptor signaling begins with activation of the Janus tyrosine kinases Jak1 and Jak3, which are associated with the receptor complex. To identify potential targets of these kinases, we examined Pyk2 (a member of the focal adhesion kinase family) using an IL-7-dependent murine thymocyte line, D1. We demonstrate that stimulation of D1 (or normal pro-T) cells by IL-7 rapidly increased tyrosine phosphorylation and enzymatic activity of Pyk2, with kinetics slightly lagging that of Jak1 and Jak3 phosphorylation. Conversely, IL-7 withdrawal resulted in a marked decrease of Pyk2 phosphorylation. Pyk2 was found to be physically associated with Jak1 prior to IL-7 stimulation and to increase its association with IL-7Ralpha chain following IL-7 stimulation. Pyk2 appeared to be involved in cell survival, because antisense Pyk2 accelerated the cell death process. Activation of Pyk2 via the muscarinic and nicotinic receptors using carbachol or via intracellular Ca(2+) rise using ionomycin/phorbol myristate acetate promoted survival in the absence of IL-7. These data support a role for Pyk2 in coupling Jak signaling to the trophic response.

Interleukin-7 (IL-7) receptor signaling begins with activation of the Janus tyrosine kinases Jak1 and Jak3, which are associated with the receptor complex. To identify potential targets of these kinases, we examined Pyk2 (a member of the focal adhesion kinase family) using an IL-7-dependent murine thymocyte line, D1. We demonstrate that stimulation of D1 (or normal pro-T) cells by IL-7 rapidly increased tyrosine phosphorylation and enzymatic activity of Pyk2, with kinetics slightly lagging that of Jak1 and Jak3 phosphorylation. Conversely, IL-7 withdrawal resulted in a marked decrease of Pyk2 phosphorylation. ",Pyk2, was found to be physically associated with Jak1 prior to ,IL-7," stimulation and to increase its association with IL-7Ralpha chain following IL-7 stimulation. Pyk2 appeared to be involved in cell survival, because antisense Pyk2 accelerated the cell death process. Activation of Pyk2 via the muscarinic and nicotinic receptors using carbachol or via intracellular Ca(2+) rise using ionomycin/phorbol myristate acetate promoted survival in the absence of IL-7. These data support a role for Pyk2 in coupling Jak signaling to the trophic response.

10702271,s7,T4,T11,"Interleukin (IL)-7 induces rapid activation of Pyk2, which is bound to Janus kinase 1 and IL-7Ralpha. 
Interleukin-7 (IL-7) receptor signaling begins with activation of the Janus tyrosine kinases Jak1 and Jak3, which are associated with the receptor complex. To identify potential targets of these kinases, we examined Pyk2 (a member of the focal adhesion kinase family) using an IL-7-dependent murine thymocyte line, D1. We demonstrate that stimulation of D1 (or normal pro-T) cells by IL-7 rapidly increased tyrosine phosphorylation and enzymatic activity of Pyk2, with kinetics slightly lagging that of Jak1 and Jak3 phosphorylation. Conversely, IL-7 withdrawal resulted in a marked decrease of Pyk2 phosphorylation. Pyk2 was found to be physically associated with Jak1 prior to IL-7 stimulation and to increase its association with IL-7Ralpha chain following IL-7 stimulation. Pyk2 appeared to be involved in cell survival, because antisense Pyk2 accelerated the cell death process. Activation of Pyk2 via the muscarinic and nicotinic receptors using carbachol or via intracellular ",Ca(2+), rise using ,ionomycin,"/phorbol myristate acetate promoted survival in the absence of IL-7. These data support a role for Pyk2 in coupling Jak signaling to the trophic response.
