Addressing the former possibility, while our immunoprecipitations with 3D11 and 4A11 did not co-precipitate equimolar amounts of MHC-I as did 4B4, it is unlikely that this evidence argues against an interaction of HLA-F and MHC-I HC on the surface. Subequimolar amounts were detected with both antibodies and it is not clear that this was due to experimental conditions (e.g. the detergent used) and possibly compounded by antibody specificities. In fact, there is a strong correlation with binding of HLA-F tetramer and the presence of surface MHC-I HC (Fig. 3). In addition, surface HLA-F is internalized upon addition of free HC antibodies, which could implicate an interaction between the two molecules prior to the addition of HC antibody. If heterodimers of MHC-I HC and HLA-F or similar complexes of homodimers of each species do exist on the surface. it would suggest the possibility for interaction with a unique receptor in trans, perhaps another polymorphic locus or group of genes.
