Specific risk haploid types in the gene Abin-1 (TNFAIP3-interacting protein 1, or Tnip1) are strongly associated with a predisposition for autoimmune inflammatory diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and psoriasis . These risk haplotypes produce lower levels of Abin-1 mRNA and ABIN-1 protein, suggesting that the susceptibility to autoimmunity is due to their hypomorphic function. Abin-1-/- mice die during late embryogenesis due to fetal liver cell death, anaemia and hypoplasia, which can be blocked by TNFalpha deficiency .
