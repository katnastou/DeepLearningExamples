Whole mount in situ hybridization revealed that ANF expression was greatly reduced in UTXDelta/Delta embryonic heart (Fig. 3Q-T). In addition, MLC2v was also substantially decreased and the expression pattern of MLC2v was severely altered in UTXDelta/Delta embryos (Fig. 3U-Z). Together, our data establish that UTX plays a crucial role in maintaining high levels of Nxk2.5 and Tbx5 expression and marked upregulation of heart-specific genes during embryonic development.
