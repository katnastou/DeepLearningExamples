VeA protein levels (Figure 2C) were similar in wild type and mpkB mutant strains. velB RNA was unchanged whereas laeA transcripts were downregulated as previously reported (Figure S2A). TAP purification of natively expressed VeA::cTAP revealed that under conditions where sexual development was normally promoted, only significantly reduced amounts of VelB and LaeA proteins were enriched by tagged VeA in the absence of MpkB (Figure 2D, Tables S2 and S3). The MAP kinase does not affect VeA nuclear import, because the interaction of VeA with the importin KapA was not significantly affected in mpkB mutant. Consistently, nuclear import of the subunits of the trimeric VelB-VeA-LaeA complex was not affected in a mkkB mutant lacking the upstream MAP2K AnSte7 (Figure S2B). Lack of laeA normally causes enhanced VeA and VelB expression as well as enhanced complex formation. This suggests that decreased ",VeA,-VelB association is not a result of the reduced levels of LaeA in ,mpkB," mutants.
