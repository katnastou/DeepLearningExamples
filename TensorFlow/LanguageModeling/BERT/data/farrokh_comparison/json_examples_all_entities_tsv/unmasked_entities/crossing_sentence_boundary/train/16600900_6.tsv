To investigate this possibility, we utilized the powerful budding yeast genetic system to identify such genes, and report here the identification of a novel gene, ",CRT10,", whose mutation enhances ",hydroxyurea," (HU) resistance. Genetic characterization indicates that CRT10 is involved in the transcriptional regulation of RNR genes.
