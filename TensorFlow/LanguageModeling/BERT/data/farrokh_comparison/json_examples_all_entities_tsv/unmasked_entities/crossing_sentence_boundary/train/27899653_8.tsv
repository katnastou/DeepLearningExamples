27899653_8,s0,T1,T2,We found that ,KLHL12, can differentially interact with ,KHSRP," and promote KHSRP ubiquitination. We then sought to elucidate how KLHL12-mediated KHSRP ubiquitination affects IRES-driven translation. This led us to identify a hitherto undescribed regulatory mechanism of IRES-driven translation involving ubiquitination--namely, the regulation of IRES-dependent translation via ubiquitin modulation of ITAFs. Our findings are expected to have important implications for future research regarding viral-host interactions, and may also help to identify novel drug targets for anti-viral therapies.
