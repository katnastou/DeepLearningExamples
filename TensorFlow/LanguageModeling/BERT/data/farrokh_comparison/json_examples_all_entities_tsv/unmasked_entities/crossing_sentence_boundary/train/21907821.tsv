Shiga toxins produced by Escherichia coli O157:H7 are responsible for food poisoning and hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS). The A subunits of Shiga toxins (Stx1A and Stx2A) inhibit translation by depurinating a specific adenine in the large rRNA. To determine if Stx1A and Stx2A require the ribosomal stalk for depurination, their activity and cytotoxicity were examined in the yeast P protein deletion mutants. Stx1A and Stx2A were less toxic and depurinated ribosomes less in a strain lacking P1/P2 on the ribosome and in the cytosol (DeltaP2) than in a strain lacking P1/P2 on the ribosome, but containing free P2 in the cytosol (DeltaP1). To determine if cytoplasmic P proteins facilitated depurination, Stx1A and Stx2A were expressed in the P0DeltaAB mutant, in which the binding sites for P1/P2 were deleted on the ribosome, and P1/P2 accumulated in the cytosol. Stx1A was less toxic and depurinated ribosomes less in P0DeltaAB, suggesting that intact binding sites for P1/P2 were critical. In contrast, Stx2A was toxic and depurinated ribosomes in P0DeltaAB as in wild type, suggesting that it did not require the P1/P2 binding sites. Depurination of DeltaP1, but not P0DeltaAB ribosomes increased upon addition of purified P1alpha/P2betain vitro, and the increase was greater for Stx1 than for Stx2. We conclude that cytoplasmic P proteins stimulate depurination by Stx1 by facilitating the access of the toxin to the ribosome. Although ribosomal stalk is important for Stx1 and Stx2 to depurinate the ribosome, Stx2 is less dependent on the stalk proteins for activity than Stx1 and can depurinate ribosomes with an incomplete stalk better than Stx1.

Shiga toxins produced by Escherichia coli O157:H7 are responsible for food poisoning and hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS).

Stx1A and Stx2A were less toxic and depurinated ribosomes less in a strain lacking P1/",P2," on the ribosome and in the cytosol (DeltaP2) than in a strain lacking P1/P2 on the ribosome, but containing free ",P2," in the cytosol (DeltaP1). To determine if cytoplasmic P proteins facilitated depurination, Stx1A and Stx2A were expressed in the P0DeltaAB mutant, in which the binding sites for P1/P2 were deleted on the ribosome, and P1/P2 accumulated in the cytosol.

In contrast, Stx2A was toxic and depurinated ribosomes in P0DeltaAB as in wild type, suggesting that it did not require the P1/P2 binding sites. Depurination of DeltaP1, but not P0DeltaAB ribosomes increased upon addition of purified P1alpha/P2betain vitro, and the increase was greater for Stx1 than for Stx2. We conclude that cytoplasmic P proteins stimulate depurination by Stx1 by facilitating the access of the toxin to the ribosome.

The A subunits of Shiga toxins (Stx1A and Stx2A) inhibit translation by depurinating a specific adenine in the large rRNA. To determine if Stx1A and Stx2A require the ribosomal stalk for depurination, their activity and cytotoxicity were examined in the yeast P protein deletion mutants. Stx1A and Stx2A were less toxic and depurinated ribosomes less in a strain lacking P1/P2 on the ribosome and in the cytosol (DeltaP2) than in a strain lacking P1/P2 on the ribosome, but containing free P2 in the cytosol (DeltaP1). To determine if cytoplasmic P proteins facilitated depurination, ",Stx1A," and Stx2A were expressed in the P0DeltaAB mutant, in which the binding sites for P1/P2 were deleted on the ribosome, and P1/",P2," accumulated in the cytosol. Stx1A was less toxic and depurinated ribosomes less in P0DeltaAB, suggesting that intact binding sites for P1/P2 were critical. In contrast, Stx2A was toxic and depurinated ribosomes in P0DeltaAB as in wild type, suggesting that it did not require the P1/P2 binding sites. Depurination of DeltaP1, but not P0DeltaAB ribosomes increased upon addition of purified P1alpha/P2betain vitro, and the increase was greater for Stx1 than for Stx2. We conclude that cytoplasmic P proteins stimulate depurination by Stx1 by facilitating the access of the toxin to the ribosome. Although ribosomal stalk is important for Stx1 and Stx2 to depurinate the ribosome, Stx2 is less dependent on the stalk proteins for activity than Stx1 and can depurinate ribosomes with an incomplete stalk better than Stx1.

Shiga toxins produced by Escherichia coli O157:H7 are responsible for food poisoning and hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS). The A subunits of Shiga toxins (Stx1A and Stx2A) inhibit translation by depurinating a specific adenine in the large rRNA. To determine if Stx1A and Stx2A require the ribosomal stalk for depurination, their activity and cytotoxicity were examined in the yeast P protein deletion mutants. Stx1A and Stx2A were less toxic and depurinated ribosomes less in a strain lacking P1/P2 on the ribosome and in the cytosol (DeltaP2) than in a strain lacking P1/P2 on the ribosome, but containing free P2 in the cytosol (DeltaP1). To determine if cytoplasmic P proteins facilitated depurination, Stx1A and Stx2A were expressed in the P0DeltaAB mutant, in which the binding sites for P1/P2 were deleted on the ribosome, and P1/P2 accumulated in the cytosol. Stx1A was less toxic and depurinated ribosomes less in P0DeltaAB, suggesting that intact binding sites for P1/P2 were critical. In contrast, ",Stx2A," was toxic and depurinated ribosomes in P0DeltaAB as in wild type, suggesting that it did not require the P1/",P2," binding sites. Depurination of DeltaP1, but not P0DeltaAB ribosomes increased upon addition of purified P1alpha/P2betain vitro, and the increase was greater for Stx1 than for Stx2.
