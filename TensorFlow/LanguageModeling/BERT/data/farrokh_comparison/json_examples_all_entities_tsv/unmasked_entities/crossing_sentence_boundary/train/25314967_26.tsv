25314967_26,s2,T1,T8,"Primary mouse LECs were isolated from skin or mesenteric tissues of wild-type and LEC-DKO mice as previously described. Briefly, the finely minced skin or mesentery tissue was digested with enzyme solution (2 mg/ml collagenase, 5 mg/ml dispase; Roche) at 37degreesC for 1 hour, then the cells were cultured in complete endothelial cell medium (Invitrogen). Anti-",Podoplanin," antibody (clone 8F11, MBL) was first labeled with ",Biotin," (EZ-Link(R) Micro Sulfo-NHS-LC Biotinylation Kit) according to the manufacture's instructions. LECs were further purified by streptavidin-conjugated magnetic beads (Pierce) after cells were incubated with biotinylated anti-Podoplanin antibodies for 2 hours at room temperature. The identity of LECs was confirmed with LYVE-1 immunofluorescence staining and VEGFR3 flow cytometry analysis. LEC purity (>90%) was measured by expressions of LYVE-1 and VEGFR3. Deletion of epsin 1 and 2 were confirmed by quantitative RT-PCR and Western blotting.
