We confirmed previous data showing that Dex increased GR and HDAC2 association with the p65-NF-kappaB complex (Fig. 3 A). However, GR was not recruited to the p65-NF-kappaB complex after HDAC2 KD (Fig. 3 A). Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) analysis showed that Dex failed to inhibit histone 4 acetylation at the p65-NF-kappaB binding site in the GM-CSF promoter region after HDAC2 KD (Fig. 3 C). Thus, HDAC2 KD did not reduce the ability of ",GR, to induce ,GR,"-sensitive gene expression but had a preferential effect on the suppression of NF-kappaB-mediated inflammatory gene expression.
