The CD2 T lymphocyte glycoprotein surface molecule mediates both cell to cell adhesion and T cell activation, two processes that are involved in the spread of HIV infection. Treatment of chronically HIV-infected PBMC with anti-CD2 mAb has been shown to induce the expression of infectious virus from these cultures. In this study we investigated the mechanisms whereby anti-CD2 antibodies stimulate viral production. We demonstrate that treatment of transiently transfected T lymphocytes with anti-CD2 antibodies results in activation of the HIV long terminal repeat. Furthermore, ",CAT, assays using mutated HIV long terminal repeat-CAT constructs and gel shift assays demonstrate that this activation is dependent on the ,NF-kappa B," enhancer. These studies suggest that interaction of CD2 with its natural ligand, LFA-3, may play a role in regulation of HIV expression. ",Not_a_complex
