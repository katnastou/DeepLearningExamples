26791243_28,s0,T1,T10,The question of how ,dPIS, overexpression could change the level of ,PA,", via even a potential alternative pathway, is still unanswered. It was shown in yeast that the amount of PA can transcriptionally regulate the level of PI synthase. The soluble transcriptional repressor Opi1p is inhibited by binding to PA at the ER, but can rapidly translocate into the nucleus in response to inositol-induced PA consumption. In the Drosophila retina, a mutation of the lipid phosphate phosphohydrolase led to elevated PA levels, which were coupled with PI synthase transcript upregulation. This suggests that the level of PA and the level of PI synthase transcription are somehow connected with each other. This is consistent with our results, where dPIS is slightly upregulated in the CdsAms1 mutant. However, because of the transcriptional shut-off after meiosis, the cells are probably not able to compensate the elevated PA level in the mutant by increasing the amount of dPIS and other factors. One possible strategy to find the precise biochemical pathway responsible for the suppression of male sterility of CdsAms1 by overexpression of dPIS would be to correlate the lipidomic observations with testis-specific gene expression or proteomic analysis of transcription factors, as well as lipid metabolic enzymes and their regulators.
