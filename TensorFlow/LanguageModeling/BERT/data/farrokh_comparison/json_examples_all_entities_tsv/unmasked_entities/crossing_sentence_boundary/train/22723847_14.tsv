We found that these three proteins had similar distributions: GFP-tagged proteins were found mostly in the cytoplasm, in various growth conditions (data not shown), as described in databases for Ubp9 and Duf1. Biochemical fractionation of chromosomal-encoded HA-tagged proteins indicated that, in addition to the cytoplasmic soluble fraction, these proteins also display a membrane-bound fraction, possibly associated with mitochondria (Supplemental Fig. S2 B-C).
