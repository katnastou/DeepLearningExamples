At least three independent experiments were performed for each tunicamycin concentration (0-7.5 or 0-5 mug/ml), and three plates for each treatment were analyzed in each experiment; n values above the bars are the total number of embryos. To examine ",tunicamycin," sensitivity of worms treated with RNAi, embryos were transferred to duplicated RNAi feeding plates seeded with ",rnf-121," dsRNA-producing bacteria or with bacteria containing the empty feeding vector L4440 as a control. Plates were maintained in 20degreesC, and four P0 larvae were transferred to fresh RNAi plates every day. F1s gravid adults were transferred to RNAi plates containing different amount of tunicamycin. The rnf-121(ok848) worms exhibit higher sensitivity to 2 mug/ml tunicamycin compared with rnf-121(RNAi)-treated worms suggesting incomplete silencing of this gene by RNAi (compare Figure 2A to Figure 3A, top, at 2 mug/ml tunicamycin).
