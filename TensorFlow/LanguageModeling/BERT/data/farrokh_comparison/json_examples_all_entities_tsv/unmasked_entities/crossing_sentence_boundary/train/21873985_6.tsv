While the polymerization activity of Spire was mapped to its four-W domain repeat , VopL construct 3W, comprising the three W domains, had negligible activity compared to the spontaneous polymerization of actin alone (Fig. 1b). In contrast, 3W-VCD, comprising in addition the VCD, had very strong activity (Fig. 1b), which increased in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1c and Supplementary Fig. 2a). This construct had even stronger activity than the Arp2/3 complex analyzed at the same concentration (25 nM) with activation by 250 nM N-WASP WCA (Supplementary Fig. 3). A fragment corresponding to the four W domain repeat of Drosophila Spire (residues 366-482) had negligible activity at this concentration (Supplementary Fig. 3), which is consistent with previous reports (analyzed further below).
