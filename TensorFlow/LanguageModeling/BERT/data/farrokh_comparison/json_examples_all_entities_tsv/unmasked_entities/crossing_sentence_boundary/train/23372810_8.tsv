Here we present evidence that Est1 protein levels oscillate during the cell cycle through an APC-dependent mechanism in vivo. Degradation requires three sequences in Est1p that match the D-box consensus, consistent with direct recognition of Est1p by the APC. However, recombinant Est1 protein is not degraded or ubiquitinated by the APC in vitro, suggesting that Est1p either lacks the necessary structure or modification(s) that influence APC recognition in vivo or is an indirect target of the APC.
