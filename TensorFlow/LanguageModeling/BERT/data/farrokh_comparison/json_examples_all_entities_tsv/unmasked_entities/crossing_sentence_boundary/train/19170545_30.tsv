We tested this prediction by measuring the inhibition constant of the CoA analog desulfoCoA, in which the CH2SH is replaced with CH3. Because the activity assay is based on measuring CoA formation using DTNB, CoA itself could not be tested. The desulfoCoA was shown to be tight binding competitive inhibitor of hTHEM2 catalysis (Ki = 9 muM; Table 2).
