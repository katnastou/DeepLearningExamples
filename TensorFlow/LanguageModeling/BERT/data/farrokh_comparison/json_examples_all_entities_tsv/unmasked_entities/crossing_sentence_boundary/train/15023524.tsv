In this paper, we describe the characterization of DEF6, a novel PH-DH-like protein related to SWAP-70 that functions as an upstream activator of Rho GTPases. In NIH 3T3 cells, stimulation of the PI 3-kinase signaling pathway with either H2O2 or platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) resulted in the translocation of an overexpressed DEF6-GFP fusion protein to the cell membrane and induced the formation of filopodia and lamellipodia. In contrast to full-length DEF6, expression of the DH-like (DHL) domain as a GFP fusion protein potently induced actin polymerization, including stress fiber formation in COS-7 cells, in the absence of PI 3-kinase signaling, indicating that it was constitutively active. The GTP-loading of Cdc42 was strongly enhanced in NIH 3T3 cells expressing the DH domain while filopodia formation, membrane ruffling, and stress fiber formation could be inhibited by the co-expression of the DH domain with dominant negative mutants of either N17Rac1, N17Cdc42, or N19RhoA, respectively. This indicated that DEF6 acts upstream of the Rho GTPases resulting in the activation of the Cdc42, Rac1, and RhoA signaling pathways. In vitro, DEF6 specifically interacted with Rac1, Rac2, Cdc42, and RhoA, suggesting a direct role for DEF6 in the activation of Rho GTPases. The ability of DEF6 to both stimulate actin polymerization and bind to filamentous actin suggests a role for DEF6 in regulating cell shape, polarity, and movement.

In this paper, we describe the characterization of ",DEF6,", a novel PH-DH-like protein related to SWAP-70 that functions as an upstream activator of Rho GTPases. In NIH 3T3 cells, stimulation of the PI 3-kinase signaling pathway with either H2O2 or platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) resulted in the translocation of an overexpressed DEF6-GFP fusion protein to the cell membrane and induced the formation of filopodia and lamellipodia. In contrast to full-length DEF6, expression of the DH-like (DHL) domain as a GFP fusion protein potently induced actin polymerization, including stress fiber formation in COS-7 cells, in the absence of PI 3-kinase signaling, indicating that it was constitutively active. The GTP-loading of Cdc42 was strongly enhanced in NIH 3T3 cells expressing the DH domain while filopodia formation, membrane ruffling, and stress fiber formation could be inhibited by the co-expression of the DH domain with dominant negative mutants of either N17Rac1, N17Cdc42, or N19RhoA, respectively. This indicated that DEF6 acts upstream of the Rho GTPases resulting in the activation of the Cdc42, Rac1, and RhoA signaling pathways. In vitro, DEF6 specifically interacted with Rac1, Rac2, Cdc42, and RhoA, suggesting a direct role for DEF6 in the activation of Rho GTPases. The ability of DEF6 to both stimulate actin polymerization and bind to filamentous actin suggests a role for DEF6 in regulating cell shape, polarity, and movement.

In this paper, we describe the characterization of DEF6, a novel PH-DH-like protein related to SWAP-70 that functions as an upstream activator of Rho GTPases. In NIH 3T3 cells, stimulation of the PI 3-kinase signaling pathway with either ",H2O2, or platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) resulted in the translocation of an overexpressed ,DEF6,"-GFP fusion protein to the cell membrane and induced the formation of filopodia and lamellipodia. In contrast to full-length DEF6, expression of the DH-like (DHL) domain as a GFP fusion protein potently induced actin polymerization, including stress fiber formation in COS-7 cells, in the absence of PI 3-kinase signaling, indicating that it was constitutively active. The GTP-loading of Cdc42 was strongly enhanced in NIH 3T3 cells expressing the DH domain while filopodia formation, membrane ruffling, and stress fiber formation could be inhibited by the co-expression of the DH domain with dominant negative mutants of either N17Rac1, N17Cdc42, or N19RhoA, respectively. This indicated that DEF6 acts upstream of the Rho GTPases resulting in the activation of the Cdc42, Rac1, and RhoA signaling pathways. In vitro, DEF6 specifically interacted with Rac1, Rac2, Cdc42, and RhoA, suggesting a direct role for DEF6 in the activation of Rho GTPases.

In this paper, we describe the characterization of DEF6, a novel PH-DH-like protein related to SWAP-70 that functions as an upstream activator of Rho GTPases. In NIH 3T3 cells, stimulation of the PI 3-kinase signaling pathway with either H2O2 or platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) resulted in the translocation of an overexpressed DEF6-GFP fusion protein to the cell membrane and induced the formation of filopodia and lamellipodia. In contrast to full-length DEF6, expression of the DH-like (DHL) domain as a GFP fusion protein potently induced actin polymerization, including stress fiber formation in COS-7 cells, in the absence of PI 3-kinase signaling, indicating that it was constitutively active. The GTP-loading of ",Cdc42," was strongly enhanced in NIH 3T3 cells expressing the DH domain while filopodia formation, membrane ruffling, and stress fiber formation could be inhibited by the co-expression of the DH domain with dominant negative mutants of either N17Rac1, ",N17Cdc42,", or N19RhoA, respectively.

In this paper, we describe the characterization of DEF6, a novel PH-DH-like protein related to SWAP-70 that functions as an upstream activator of Rho GTPases. In NIH 3T3 cells, stimulation of the PI 3-kinase signaling pathway with either H2O2 or platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) resulted in the translocation of an overexpressed DEF6-GFP fusion protein to the cell membrane and induced the formation of filopodia and lamellipodia. In contrast to full-length DEF6, expression of the DH-like (DHL) domain as a GFP fusion protein potently induced actin polymerization, including stress fiber formation in COS-7 cells, in the absence of PI 3-kinase signaling, indicating that it was constitutively active. The GTP-loading of Cdc42 was strongly enhanced in NIH 3T3 cells expressing the DH domain while filopodia formation, membrane ruffling, and stress fiber formation could be inhibited by the co-expression of the DH domain with dominant negative mutants of either N17Rac1, N17Cdc42, or N19RhoA, respectively.
