The interaction between the phosphate group of pUb and Parkin occurs through the side chains of His302 and Arg305 (refs). As shown previously, Parkin mutants that disrupt pUb binding (H302A) indeed do not translocate to depolarized mitochondria (Fig. 2a,b), nor do they ubiquitinate mitochondrial substrates in ubiquitination assays (Fig. 2c,d). In addition, disruption of the hydrophobic interaction between pUb and Parkin by the A320R mutation was found to completely block Parkin translocation (Supplementary Fig. 2). To determine whether this effect was mediated through the inability of the Ubl domain to be released from RING1, we made Parkin double mutants that disrupt the Ubl:RING1 interface and pUb binding, and tested their activity in cells and in vitro. We found that cells expressing H302A/N273K or A320R/N273K Parkin double mutants showed significantly delayed recruitment to depolarized mitochondria compared to WT (Fig. 2a,b and Supplementary Fig. 2). The release of the Ubl domain is therefore insufficient to rescue mutant Parkin variants defective in pUb binding. Binding of pUb to Parkin was also proposed to help release the REP and affect the RING0:RING2 interface. Therefore, we next asked whether activating mutations that release the REP or disrupt the RING0:RING2 interface could rescue deficits in pUb binding by making Parkin double mutants (H302A/W403A, H302A/F146A, A320R/W403A or A320R/F146A). Neither the W403A- nor F146A-activating mutations were able to rescue deficits in Parkin recruitment and ubiquitination (Fig. 2a-d and Supplementary Fig. 2), although low levels of mitochondrial recruitment could be observed in the H302A/W403A and H302A/F146A mutants at late time points. This confirms that the role of pUb as a Parkin receptor is primordial.

The release of the Ubl domain is therefore insufficient to rescue mutant ",Parkin, variants defective in ,pUb," binding. Binding of pUb to Parkin was also proposed to help release the REP and affect the RING0:RING2 interface. Therefore, we next asked whether activating mutations that release the REP or disrupt the RING0:RING2 interface could rescue deficits in pUb binding by making Parkin double mutants (H302A/W403A, H302A/F146A, A320R/W403A or A320R/F146A). Neither the W403A- nor F146A-activating mutations were able to rescue deficits in Parkin recruitment and ubiquitination (Fig. 2a-d and Supplementary Fig. 2), although low levels of mitochondrial recruitment could be observed in the H302A/W403A and H302A/F146A mutants at late time points. This confirms that the role of pUb as a Parkin receptor is primordial.

28276439_10,s7,T14,T27,"The binding of pUb to Parkin acts as an allosteric modulator, dissociating the Ubl domain from RING1 and making Ser65 more accessible for phosphorylation. The interaction between the phosphate group of pUb and Parkin occurs through the side chains of His302 and Arg305 (refs). As shown previously, Parkin mutants that disrupt pUb binding (H302A) indeed do not translocate to depolarized mitochondria (Fig. 2a,b), nor do they ubiquitinate mitochondrial substrates in ubiquitination assays (Fig. 2c,d). In addition, disruption of the hydrophobic interaction between pUb and Parkin by the A320R mutation was found to completely block Parkin translocation (Supplementary Fig. 2). To determine whether this effect was mediated through the inability of the Ubl domain to be released from RING1, we made Parkin double mutants that disrupt the Ubl:RING1 interface and pUb binding, and tested their activity in cells and in vitro. We found that cells expressing H302A/N273K or A320R/N273K Parkin double mutants showed significantly delayed recruitment to depolarized mitochondria compared to WT (Fig. 2a,b and Supplementary Fig. 2).
