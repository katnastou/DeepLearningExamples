Among the candidates listed in Fig. 2b, we found that CENP-E was the only protein whose localization on kinetochore was obviously affected in NKAP-knockdown cells (Fig. 2b; Supplementary Fig. 3d-k). The CENP-E signal intensity on kinetochores was significantly decreased for both aligned and misaligned chromosomes in NKAP-knockdown cells (Fig. 2c,d). Since previous reports suggested that NKAP is a transcriptional corepressor, we performed a real-time PCR analysis and the result showed that NKAP knockdown did not affect the transcription of CENP-E (Supplementary Fig. 3l). We also demonstrated that NKAP knockdown had no effect on the protein level of CENP-E and other proteins, which have been reported to regulate CENP-E kinetochore localization (Fig. 2e). Moreover, similar with NKAP, CENP-E knockdown resulted in a marked increase of the depolymerization of microtubules on cold treatment, which is consistent with the effect of NKAP knockdown on CENP-E kinetochore localization (Supplementary Fig. 3m).
