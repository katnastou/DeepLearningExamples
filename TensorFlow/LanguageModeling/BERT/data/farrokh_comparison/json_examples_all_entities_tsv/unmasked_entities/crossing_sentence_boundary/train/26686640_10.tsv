To directly address whether Mcm10 functions in MCM DH splitting prior to or during origin unwinding, we monitored the relative DH levels during S phase progression in a conditional Mcm10 depletion background. We combined both temperature induced (td) and auxin induced (aid) degrons to deplete endogenous Mcm10 proteins. The td and aid degrons were turned on by switching to growth at 37degreesC and adding indole-3-acetic acid (IAA), respectively. The Ubr1 and Tir1 ubiquitin ligases were induced by galactose. The cellular Mcm10 protein was barely detectable after incubation in galactose for 1h and shifting to 37degreesC in the presence of auxin for another 2h (Figure 2C, lane 4), leading to cell death in the absence of WT Mcm10 (Figure S2B). Strikingly, under such an efficient Mcm10 depletion condition, the ratio of untagged Mcm2 to Mcm2-GFP in the GFP-trap remained almost constant after being released from alpha-factor into S phase for 120 min, indicating a failure in separation of MCM DHs (Figure 2D, upper panel and 2E, Figure S2C). Furthermore, no DNA synthesis was detected by flow cytometry (Figure 2F). In contrast, if WT Mcm10 was expressed from a plasmid in the same strain, the untagged Mcm2 in precipitates decreased quickly upon S phase entry (Figure 2D, lower panel and 2E, Figure S2C), indicating efficient DH separation. There is little untagged Mcm2 left in the precipitates at 60 min, which correlates well with the time of completion of DNA replication, as shown in the flow cytometry profiles (Figure 2F).

To directly address whether Mcm10 functions in MCM DH splitting prior to or during origin unwinding, we monitored the relative DH levels during S phase progression in a conditional Mcm10 depletion background. We combined both temperature induced (td) and auxin induced (aid) degrons to deplete endogenous Mcm10 proteins. The td and aid degrons were turned on by switching to growth at 37degreesC and adding indole-3-acetic acid (IAA), respectively. The Ubr1 and Tir1 ubiquitin ligases were induced by galactose. The cellular Mcm10 protein was barely detectable after incubation in galactose for 1h and shifting to 37degreesC in the presence of auxin for another 2h (Figure 2C, lane 4), leading to cell death in the absence of WT Mcm10 (Figure S2B). Strikingly, under such an efficient Mcm10 depletion condition, the ratio of untagged Mcm2 to ",Mcm2,-,GFP," in the GFP-trap remained almost constant after being released from alpha-factor into S phase for 120 min, indicating a failure in separation of MCM DHs (Figure 2D, upper panel and 2E, Figure S2C). Furthermore, no DNA synthesis was detected by flow cytometry (Figure 2F). In contrast, if WT Mcm10 was expressed from a plasmid in the same strain, the untagged Mcm2 in precipitates decreased quickly upon S phase entry (Figure 2D, lower panel and 2E, Figure S2C), indicating efficient DH separation. There is little untagged Mcm2 left in the precipitates at 60 min, which correlates well with the time of completion of DNA replication, as shown in the flow cytometry profiles (Figure 2F). Taken together, these data suggest an essential role of Mcm10 in MCM DH splitting.
