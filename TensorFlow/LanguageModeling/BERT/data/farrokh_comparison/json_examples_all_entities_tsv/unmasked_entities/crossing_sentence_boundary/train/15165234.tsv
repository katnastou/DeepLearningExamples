This communication identifies, for the first time, a receptor protein for signal perception from the P(II) signal transduction protein in the cyanobacterium Synechococcus elongatus. P(II), a phosphoprotein that signals the carbon/nitrogen status of the cells, forms a tight complex with the key enzyme of the arginine biosynthetic pathway, N-acetylglutamate (NAG) kinase. In complex with P(II), the catalytic activity of NAG kinase is strongly enhanced. Complex formation does not require the effector molecules of P(II), 2-oxoglutarate and ATP, but it is highly susceptible to modifications at the phosphorylation site of P(II), Ser-49. Stable complexes were only formed with the non-phosphorylated form of P(II) but not with Ser-49 mutants. In accordance with these data, NAG kinase activity in S. elongatus extracts correlated with the phosphorylation state of P(II), with high NAG kinase activities corresponding to non-phosphorylated P(II) (nitrogen-excess conditions) and low activities to increased levels of P(II) phosphorylation (nitrogen-poor conditions), thus subjecting the key enzyme of arginine biosynthesis to global nitrogen control.
