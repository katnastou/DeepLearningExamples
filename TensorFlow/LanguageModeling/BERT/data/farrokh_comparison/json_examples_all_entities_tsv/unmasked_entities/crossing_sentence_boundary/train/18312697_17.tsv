18312697_17,s6,T23,T8,"An important unresolved issue is the identification of physiological substrates of SCFFbh1 that presumably regulate the HR pathway. A recent study has shown that hFBH1 has a short half-life when it is expressed in S. cerevisiae, and its degradation depends on the presence of a functional F-box and yeast SCF components, suggesting that one candidate for a SCFhFBH1 substrate is hFBH1 itself. The rapid turnover of hFBH1 might contribute to the tight regulation of hFBH1 helicase activity. However, if SCFhFBH1 complex formation is also necessary for its nuclear transport and recruitment to DNA damage sites, the alteration in subcellular localization caused by the F-box mutation might affect hFBH1 stability in budding yeast cells. In addition, many F-box proteins identified to date target more than one substrate for degradation. Since our present data suggest that Fbh1 functions as an SCFFbh1 ubiquitin ligase complex for HR repair, the most plausible candidates as SCFFbh1 substrates are HR proteins, including Rhp51. For example, ",SCFFbh1, might contribute to regulate ,Rhp51,"-dependent HR by promoting the ubiquitination of Rhp51 or other recombination proteins. Future studies will be needed to determine whether Fbh1 is a physiological SCFFbh1 substrate and to identify other SCFFbh1 substrates, which would provide a means to conduct a more detailed analysis of its function in HR repair.
