The cellular and molecular basis for CUL9 function in tumor suppression is unclear. Prompted by the function of the 3M complex in maintaining microtubule integrity (Yan et al. accompanying paper) and the previous report that CUL7 forms a heterodimer with CUL9, we investigated the function of CUL9 in maintaining genome stability and its functional relationship with CUL7 and the 3M complex. These studies led to the discovery that CUL9 is a critical downstream effector of the 3M complex in the maintenance of microtubules and genome integrity and that survivin is a substrate of CUL9.
