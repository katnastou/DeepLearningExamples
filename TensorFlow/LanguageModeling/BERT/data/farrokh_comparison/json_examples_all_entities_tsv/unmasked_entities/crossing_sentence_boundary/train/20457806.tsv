20457806,s0,T1,T18,,Mds3, regulates morphogenesis in Candida albicans through the ,TOR," pathway. 
The success of Candida albicans as a major human fungal pathogen is dependent on its ability to colonize and survive as a commensal on diverse mucosal surfaces. One trait required for survival and virulence in the host is the morphogenetic yeast-to-hypha transition. Mds3 was identified as a regulator of pH-dependent morphogenesis that functions in parallel with the classic Rim101 pH-sensing pathway. Microarray analyses revealed that mds3 Delta/Delta cells had an expression profile indicative of a hyperactive TOR pathway, including the preferential expression of genes encoding ribosomal proteins and a decreased expression of genes involved in nitrogen source utilization. The transcriptional and morphological defects of the mds3 Delta/Delta mutant were rescued by rapamycin, an inhibitor of TOR, and this rescue was lost in strains carrying the rapamycin-resistant TOR1-1 allele or an rbp1 Delta/Delta deletion. Rapamycin also rescued the transcriptional and morphological defects associated with the loss of Sit4, a TOR pathway effector, but not the loss of Rim101 or Ras1. The sit4 Delta/Delta and mds3 Delta/Delta mutants had additional phenotypic similarities, suggesting that Sit4 and Mds3 function similarly in the TOR pathway. Finally, we found that Mds3 and Sit4 coimmunoprecipitate. Thus, Mds3 is a new member of the TOR pathway that contributes to morphogenesis in C. albicans as a regulator of this key morphogenetic pathway.
