B31 cells lack the K(+) efflux system and were reported to show overloaded K(+)-mediated growth inhibition in high K(+) media upon heterologous expression of a mammalian inwardly rectifying K(+) channel (Kir2.1). We show that while the expression of wild-type Kir2.1 channel inhibits the growth of B31 cells in high K(+) media, the human disease-causing mutations of Kir2.1 that abolish K(+) conduction (V302M) or surface trafficking (Delta314/315) fully restores the growth. The expression of ",two-pore-domain K(+) channel, ,KCNK3," or KCNK9 also inhibited the growth of B31 in high K(+) media while C-terminal mutations that reduce their 14-3-3 protein-dependent cell surface trafficking restored the growth of B31. Finally, the expression of Kir2.1 channels that were C-terminally fused with known sequence motifs including ER retention/retrieval signals and an endocytosis signal allowed the growth of B31 in high K(+) media. These results demonstrate the potential of B31 yeast strain as a unique biological tool to screen the random peptide libraries for novel sequence signals that down-regulate surface expression of membrane proteins, as well as to systematically identify the structural determinants for cell surface trafficking and/or ion conductance of K(+) channels.
