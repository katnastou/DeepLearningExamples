Phosphorylation sites were mapped to the C-teminal half of the protein, beyond residue 260, while a serine-rich stretch from residue 175 to 199 was dispensable for the phosphorylation of Sc. We focused on the (S/T)P sites of the C-terminal half (S217, S268 and T329), as such motifs are often ",kinase," targets, e.g. for ",Cdk's," and MAPK's. S268 is part of a highly conserved SPxxS motif, found in all Sc homologues (data not shown). We altered two, three or five S/T residues to non-phosphorylatable alanines or valines and named the mutants m2p, m3p or m5p, respectively; see Figure 1A and Supplementary Data for description. From these mutants we concluded that phosphorylation of Sc is primarily dependent on this 268-SPTSS motif (Figure 1A). We also tested a basic domain point mutant, Sc[RQEQ]. This carries two amino acid changes, R104Q and E108Q, which abolish DNA binding with consequent loss of activity (Supplementary Figure S1). In agreement with the Sc[164-345] truncation, which lacks the entire bHLH region, the basic domain mutant did not abolish phosphorylation. When isolated from larval wing disks Sc[m3p] migrated faster than wt Sc, consistent with Sc being phosphorylated via its SPTSS motif also in native tissues (Figure 1B).
