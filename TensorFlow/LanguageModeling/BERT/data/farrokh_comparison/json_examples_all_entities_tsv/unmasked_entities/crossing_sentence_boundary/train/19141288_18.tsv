The PhK/GPb complex was analyzed by gel filtration on a Superose 6 column, but the results were inconclusive. The Km for the PhK phosphorylation of GPb is 9 muM (Table 1). For the truncated gamma kinase subunit of PhK and for some other protein kinases, the kinetic constant is close to the dissociation constant. Hence, Kd for PhK/GPb could be ~9 muM. However, used an ELISA assay to measure affinities and found an apparent Kd ~40 nM for control conditions that was reduced to an apparent Kd 5 nM in the presence of Mg2+ and Ca2+. Although the work provided valuable comparative values, as the authors comment, because the ELISA assay requires immobilization of one of the pairs, the Kd values do not necessarily reflect the Kd for binding in solution. The concentrations used in preparing the PhK/GPb sample (PhK tetramer 2.22 mg/ml [1.71 muM] and GPb dimer 1.08 mg/ml [5.54 muM]) correspond to 1 PhK (alphabetagammadelta):0.8 GPb dimer. Depending on the value of Kd, saturation of PhK with GPb could have been between 1% and 80%. The appearance of the particles on the grids showed all particles with an increase in size, indicating that some were GPb bound, compared with the native PhK particles.
