19748354_11,s0,T13,T1,To examine whether coordinated ,ATP," hydrolysis is conserved in human m-AAA proteases, we expressed ",paraplegin," and AFG3L2 or variants thereof harboring mutations in the AAA domain in Deltayta10Deltayta12 cells. In this experimental setting, respiratory growth depends on paraplegin subunits within the hetero-oligomeric m-AAA isoenzyme when inactive AFG3L2 variants are expressed. This allowed us to monitor effects of specific mutations within the AAA domain of AFG3L2 on paraplegin activity in vivo. Coexpression of C-terminally hexahistadine tagged paraplegin with the Walker A AFG3L2 mutant partially restored respiratory growth of Deltayta10Deltayta12 cells (Fig. 2A). In contrast, respiratory growth was completely abolished when paraplegin was coexpressed with AFG3L2 harboring a mutation in the Walker B motif (Fig. 2A). Mutations in Walker B but not Walker A motifs of AFG3L2 inhibited almost completely the ATPase activity of purified hetero-oligomeric m-AAA complexes in vitro (Fig. 2B). Similar effects were observed when m-AAA proteases with analogous mutant subunits of paraplegin were analyzed (Fig. 2B). Thus, only mutations in the Walker B motif inhibited ATP hydrolysis in hetero-oligomeric human protease complexes, consistent with an inhibitory effect of ATP binding on adjacent subunits.
