IL-12 is a critical immunoregulatory cytokine that promotes cell-mediated immune responses and the differentiation of naive CD4+ cells to Th1 cells; however, relatively few IL-12 target genes have been identified. To better clarify the molecular basis of IL-12 action, we set out to characterize genes up-regulated by IL-12, first by contrasting IL-12- and IFN-alpha-inducible genes. We identified several genes up-regulated by IL-12, namely, MIP-1alpha, MIP-1beta, IL-1RA, and IFN regulatory factor-1 (IRF-1). IRF-1 is a transcription factor regulated by IFNs that is also essential for Th1 responses. We demonstrated that IL-12 directly up-regulates IRF-1 to the same extent as IFN-alpha in normal human T cells and in NK cells. We showed that IL-12 had a direct effect on IRF-1, an effect not mediated indirectly by the induction of IFN-gamma production. Furthermore, IL-2 and IL-12 synergistically induced IRF-1, whereas IFN-alpha and IL-12 did not. The participation of STAT4 in the regulation of IRF-1 was demonstrated in two ways. First, STAT4 was required for the IL-12-dependent transactivation of an IRF-1 reporter construct, and second, STAT4 binding to the IRF-1 promoter was shown using EMSA. In contrast to IL-12, no up-regulation of IRF-1 was found in IL-4-stimulated cells, and IL-4 did not block IL-12-dependent up-regulation of IRF-1. Therefore, IRF-1 may be an important contributor to IL-12 signaling, and we speculate that the defective IL-12 responses seen in IRF-1-/- mice might be attributable, in part, to the absence of this transcription factor.

To better clarify the molecular basis of IL-12 action, we set out to characterize genes up-regulated by IL-12, first by contrasting IL-12- and IFN-alpha-inducible genes.

IL-12 is a critical immunoregulatory cytokine that promotes cell-mediated immune responses and the differentiation of naive CD4+ cells to Th1 cells; however, relatively few IL-12 target genes have been identified. To better clarify the molecular basis of IL-12 action, we set out to characterize genes up-regulated by IL-12, first by contrasting IL-12- and IFN-alpha-inducible genes. We identified several genes up-regulated by IL-12, namely, MIP-1alpha, MIP-1beta, IL-1RA, and IFN regulatory factor-1 (IRF-1). IRF-1 is a transcription factor regulated by IFNs that is also essential for Th1 responses. We demonstrated that IL-12 directly up-regulates IRF-1 to the same extent as IFN-alpha in normal human T cells and in NK cells. We showed that IL-12 had a direct effect on IRF-1, an effect not mediated indirectly by the induction of IFN-gamma production. Furthermore, IL-2 and IL-12 synergistically induced IRF-1, whereas IFN-alpha and IL-12 did not. The participation of STAT4 in the regulation of IRF-1 was demonstrated in two ways. First, STAT4 was required for the IL-12-dependent transactivation of an ",IRF-1," reporter construct, and second, ",STAT4," binding to the IRF-1 promoter was shown using EMSA. In contrast to IL-12, no up-regulation of IRF-1 was found in IL-4-stimulated cells, and IL-4 did not block IL-12-dependent up-regulation of IRF-1. Therefore, IRF-1 may be an important contributor to IL-12 signaling, and we speculate that the defective IL-12 responses seen in IRF-1-/- mice might be attributable, in part, to the absence of this transcription factor.

We identified several genes up-regulated by IL-12, namely, MIP-1alpha, MIP-1beta, IL-1RA, and IFN regulatory factor-1 (IRF-1). IRF-1 is a transcription factor regulated by IFNs that is also essential for Th1 responses. We demonstrated that IL-12 directly up-regulates IRF-1 to the same extent as IFN-alpha in normal human T cells and in NK cells. We showed that IL-12 had a direct effect on IRF-1, an effect not mediated indirectly by the induction of IFN-gamma production. Furthermore, IL-2 and IL-12 synergistically induced IRF-1, whereas IFN-alpha and IL-12 did not. The participation of STAT4 in the regulation of IRF-1 was demonstrated in two ways. First, STAT4 was required for the IL-12-dependent transactivation of an IRF-1 reporter construct, and second, STAT4 binding to the IRF-1 promoter was shown using EMSA. In contrast to ",IL-12,", no up-regulation of IRF-1 was found in IL-4-stimulated cells, and ",IL-4," did not block IL-12-dependent up-regulation of IRF-1.
