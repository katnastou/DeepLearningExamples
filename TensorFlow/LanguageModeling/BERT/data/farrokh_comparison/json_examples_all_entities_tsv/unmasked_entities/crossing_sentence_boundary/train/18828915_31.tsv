These functional relationships are based upon protein-protein interactions, co-lethality, co-expression across large numbers of microarray experiments and co-citation in the literature. We were particularly interested in a gene called BNA2, because it was highly and significantly up-regulated in cdc13-1 strains (Figure 6b). Differential expression of BNA2 was not observed in the absence of telomerase, although it is expressed in response to environmental stress. Biogrid analysis revealed that BNA2 interacts genetically with a cdc13-1 suppressor, NPT1 , as co-deletion of these genes is synthetically lethal (Figure 6c).

We were particularly interested in a gene called BNA2, because it was highly and significantly up-regulated in cdc13-1 strains (Figure 6b). Differential expression of BNA2 was not observed in the absence of telomerase, although it is expressed in response to environmental stress. Biogrid analysis revealed that BNA2 interacts genetically with a cdc13-1 suppressor, NPT1 , as co-deletion of these genes is synthetically lethal (Figure 6c). NPT1 is not differentially expressed when telomeres are uncapped in cdc3-1 strains. BNA2 encodes a ","tryptophan 2,3-dioxygenase"," required for biosynthesis of nicotinic acid (an NAD+ precursor) from tryptophan via the kynurenine pathway, while NPT1 encodes a ",nicotinate phosphoribosyltransferase," that acts in the salvage pathway of NAD+ biosynthesis and is required for telomeric silencing.
