For gene deletions a derivative with deleted akuB gene was used that shows increased frequency of homologous recombination (da Silva Ferreira et al.,). A. fumigatus was cultivated at 37degreesC and liquid cultures were shaken at 200 r.p.m. Growth media were based on the Aspergillus minimal medium (AMM) (http://www.fgsc.net/methods/anidmed.html) with addition of 50 mM ",glucose, or 100 mM ,ethanol,". When required, 5 mM lysine was added to growth media. Media were inoculated with conidia suspensions. These suspensions derived from cultures grown for at least 48 h at 37degreesC on AMM glucose agar plates. Conidia were harvested in sterile water and hyphal elements and clumps were removed by filtration over a 40 mum cell strainer (BD, Heidelberg, Germany). A. nidulans strain FGSCA4 (Fungal genetic stock centre, Kansas, USA) served for isolation of genomic DNA and RNA and was cultivated identical to A. fumigatus in AMM with glucose. The A. fumigatus transformant expressing the aconitase acoA under control of the xylP promoter from P. chrysogenum was maintained on 50 mM xylose containing minimal medium. Carbon shift experiments were performed by incubating A. fumigatus strains for 24 h at 37degreesC and 200 r.p.m. shaking on 50 mM xylose liquid medium. Subsequently, mycelium was harvested over sterile miracloth (Merck/Calbiochem, Schwalbach/Ts. Germany) extensively washed with phosphate-buffered saline and transferred to fresh glucose or xylose-containing media.
