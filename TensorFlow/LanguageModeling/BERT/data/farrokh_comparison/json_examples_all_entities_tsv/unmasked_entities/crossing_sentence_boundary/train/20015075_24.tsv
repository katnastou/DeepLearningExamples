For cross-linking, the peptides were re-suspended in PBS and incubated at 4degreesC for 48 hours, or incubated with SPDP (N-succinimimidyl-3-[2-Pyridyldithiol] propionate) reagent from Pierce Co. (Rockford, IL), as described. Control experiments show that RGQOGVMGF supports vWF binding (Figure 3F), (GPO)10 induces platelet aggregation (Figure 4C), and ",GFOGER, supports platelet adhesion in a ,Ca2+,"-dependent manner (Figure 4D), indicating that all peptides were biologically active according to appropriate in vitro assays.
