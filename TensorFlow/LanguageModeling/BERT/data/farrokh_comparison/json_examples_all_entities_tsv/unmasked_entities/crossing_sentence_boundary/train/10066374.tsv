The role of the 90-kDa heat shock protein (Hsp90) as a chaperone and its regulatory functions for cellular proteins such as the glucocorticosteroid receptor (GR) depends on the direct interaction of the Hsp90 with the corresponding protein as part of a multiprotein complex. The search for the amino acid sequence(s) in Hsp90 involved in interaction with the human GR has been carried out by mutational deletion analysis in whole cells, studying the effects of interaction on the nucleocytoplasmic distributions of transiently expressed Hsp90 and GR derivatives in COS-7 cells. Using a recently developed confocal microscopic immunofluorescence method that allows quantification of the nucleocytoplasmic ratios of the proteins in individual cells and statistical comparison of cell populations, two subregions of the Hsp90 molecule have been defined that allow interaction with GR (residues 206-291 and 446-581). The latter region may play a fundamental role in the interaction, while the former may merely stabilize the binding to GR of the intact Hsp90 molecule. Moreover, the dissection of the Hsp90 molecule allowed us to define two regions displaying nuclear localization activity (residues 1-206 and 381-581), followed by two regions having a predominantly cytoplasmic localization activity (residues 287-381 and 581-728) and counteracting the nuclear localization activities.

10066374,s2,T15,T5,"Delimitation of two regions in the 90-kDa heat shock protein (Hsp90) able to interact with the glucocorticosteroid receptor (GR). 
The role of the 90-kDa heat shock protein (Hsp90) as a chaperone and its regulatory functions for cellular proteins such as the glucocorticosteroid receptor (GR) depends on the direct interaction of the Hsp90 with the corresponding protein as part of a multiprotein complex. The search for the amino acid sequence(s) in Hsp90 involved in interaction with the human ",GR," has been carried out by mutational deletion analysis in whole cells, studying the effects of interaction on the nucleocytoplasmic distributions of transiently expressed ",Hsp90," and GR derivatives in COS-7 cells. Using a recently developed confocal microscopic immunofluorescence method that allows quantification of the nucleocytoplasmic ratios of the proteins in individual cells and statistical comparison of cell populations, two subregions of the Hsp90 molecule have been defined that allow interaction with GR (residues 206-291 and 446-581). The latter region may play a fundamental role in the interaction, while the former may merely stabilize the binding to GR of the intact Hsp90 molecule. Moreover, the dissection of the Hsp90 molecule allowed us to define two regions displaying nuclear localization activity (residues 1-206 and 381-581), followed by two regions having a predominantly cytoplasmic localization activity (residues 287-381 and 581-728) and counteracting the nuclear localization activities.
