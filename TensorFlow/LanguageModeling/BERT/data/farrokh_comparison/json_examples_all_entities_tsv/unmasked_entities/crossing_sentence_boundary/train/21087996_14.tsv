Yellow, red and blue dots indicate residues involved in dimerization, RNA binding and SAM binding respectively. Secondary structure for yeast (top) and A. fulgidus (bottom) shown as open bars for alpha-helices and arrows for beta-strands and numbered according to Leulliot et al. for yeast, and Taylor et al. for A. fulgidus. (B) The scNep1 dimer. RNA binding and catalytic regions of the molecules are colored red and dark blue respectively. The molecules of SAH are shown in sticks. Secondary structure elements are labeled according to Leulliot et al.. (C) Front view of the dimerization interface of Nep1. Residues are labeled with chain names and residue numbers. (D) Top view of the interface showing the interaction of the C-terminus in the interface. Residues that are identical in eukaryotic sequences are labeled in red text.
