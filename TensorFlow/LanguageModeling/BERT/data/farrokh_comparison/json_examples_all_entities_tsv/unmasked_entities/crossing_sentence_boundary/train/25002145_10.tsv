In idm2-3, a single-nucleotide-substitution mutation (from GGG to GAG) in At1g54840 changed amino acid glycine 276 to glutamic acid.

Bisulfite sequencing analysis showed that, compared to the wild-type control, the DNA methylation level of the 35S promoter region was increased in idm1-9 and idm2-3 plants (Figure S1E). The At1g26400 region was also hypermethylated in idm1-9 and idm2-3 according to the Chop PCR results (Figure S1F). Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays showed an increased H3K9me2 level and a decreased H3K4me2 level in the 35S promoter region in the mutant plants (Figure 1E). In idm2-3, a single-nucleotide-substitution mutation (from GGG to GAG) in At1g54840 changed amino acid glycine 276 to glutamic acid. Consistent with the genetic mapping result (Figure S1G) suggesting that the idm2-3 mutation was responsible for the long-root phenotype, all of the F1 plants from genetic crosses between idm2-3 and idm2-1 (SALK_130656) had a long-root phenotype like that of idm2-3 (Figure S1H). We also transferred the wild-type IDM2 genomic fragment into idm2-3 mutant plants and found that it can complement the root phenotype (Figure S1H). These results demonstrated that, like IDM1 and ROS1, IDM2 is required for prevention of transcriptional silencing of the ",35,-SUC2 and ,35S,"-HPTII transgenes.
