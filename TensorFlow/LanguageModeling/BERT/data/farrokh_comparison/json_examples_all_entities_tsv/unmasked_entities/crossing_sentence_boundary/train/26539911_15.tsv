We first examined whether CD133 expression is essential for NTERA2 tumor cell growth by measuring bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) incorporation in cells transfected with CD133 siRNA (Figure 5a). Twenty-six percent of the CD133 knockdown cells were BrdU positive while 70% of the control cells were BrdU positive (Figure 5b); these data were corroborated in NCCIT cells (Supplementary Figure 5a).
