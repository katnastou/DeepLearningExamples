HIV infection, female gender, prostitution among females, foreign nationality, injection of heroin and cocaine, a high frequency of injecting, and obtaining syringes through the needle exchange program were independently and positively associated with skin abscesses. During follow-up, 17 verified episodes of endocarditis were observed (incidence 1.3/100 person-years). Endocarditis was independently associated with HIV infection and a previous history of endocarditis. Furthermore, women and IDU with a skin abscess appeared to be at an increased risk for endocarditis. CONCLUSIONS: HIV infection is an independent risk factor for skin abscesses and endocarditis. Also, women are at 	an increased risk	 for these injection-related infections.

Telomerization of compound 1 has been done with commonly used silane coupling agent; 3-mercaptopropyltrimethoxysilane (MPS), and the telomer (T1) was grafted onto porous silica surface to prepare a stationary phase (Sil-T1) for reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography. The composition of the new hybrid material (Sil-T1) was determined by elemental analysis, DRIFT-IR, TGA and by (13)C and (29)Si (CP/MAS) NMR spectroscopic measurements. The elemental analysis measurements revealed that the surface coverage by organic phase in Sil-T1 is significantly (about 135%) lower than commercial polymeric octadecylsilyalted 	silica	 (ODS-p). In addition, the results of (13)C CP/MAS NMR demonstrated that the N-alkyl moieties of the grafted polymers chain in Sil-T1 remained disordered, amorphous, and mobile represented by gauche conformational form. Furthermore, from the characterization data, the successful grafting process and unagglomerated state of the grafted particles (as observed by scanning electron microscopic, SEM measurements) prove the material to be suitable for HPLC application. The evaluation of chromatographic performance has been done from the retention studies of different size and shape PAHs and aromatic positional isomers. Significantly higher selectivity for PAHs was attributed by Sil-T1 than ODS-p regardless it has

Several ongoing clinical trials like Mayo Safety in Kids, Pediatric Anesthesia NeuroDevelopment Assessment, and General Anesthesia and Apoptosis Study will likely offer more clear answers in the future. In the interim, experimental models have described roles for neuroinflammation, mitochondrial damage from reactive 	oxygen	 species, and the presence of several neuronal morphology changes from anesthesia exposure. Additionally, several potential neuroprotective agents and strategies have been tested in the laboratory.

Three weeks to 26-month-old animals were investigated using light and transmission electron microscopy, enzyme histochemistry and quantitative morphology. Changes in the choriocapillaris (CC) were additionally studied by scanning electron microscopy of corrosion cast preparations. In 3-week-old mice, in which most of the outer segments of photoreceptors in the central portion of the retina had disappeared but remnants of the cells were still present, the RPE was enlarged and showed elongated microvilli. In 8-week-old animals, the photoreceptors were completely absent in large areas of the posterior pole region. In 	these areas	 the RPE was also completely lost. Quantitative evaluation performed in histological serial sections showed that loss of RPE measured as length of RPE-free Bruch's membrane, continuously increased up to the age of 20 months. In 8-week-old animals, CC adjacent to degenerating RPE showed loss of fenestration. In 10-week-old animals, the CC disappeared in those areas where the RPE was already lacking. The loss of CC increased with increasing age and in 20-month-old animals 5-10% of the entire CC was lacking. Loss of the related arterioles and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate diaphorase (NADPH-d)-positive nerve fibers occurred only in approximately 2-year-old rd-mice.

Minor polypeptides p116, p98, and p92 were associated with 	the virus core	. A scheme of the structure of porcine rotavirus virion is proposed on the basis of the virion ultrastructure and localization of viral proteins in the capsid. Attention is drawn to the fact that the "wild" strain of swine rotavirus which is virulent for piglets differed in electrophoretic mobility of at least 3 segments of virus genome from the same strain which had undergone 70 passages in cell culture. The virus with altered RNA-segments showed no virulence. The change in the molecular weight of the RNA-segment 4 correlated with the change in polypeptide p90 coded for by it. In the authors'

Polycystic kidney disease (PKD) is a heritable disease characterized by renal cysts and is a leading cause of end-stage renal disease. Dietary intervention offers a potentially efficacious, cost-effective, and safe therapeutic option for PKD. The aim of this article was to review studies investigating the effect of dietary components on PKD and potential mechanisms of action. Low-protein diets are commonly recommended for PKD patients, but inconsistent findings in 	human	 and animal PKD studies suggest that the type rather the amount of protein may be of greater importance. Dietary soy protein has been shown to have renal protective effects in various animal models of PKD. Other than dietary proteins, studies investigating the role of the amount and type of dietary lipids on PKD progression are increasing. The omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids can alter multiple steps in PKD pathogenesis. Phytoestrogens and phytochemicals are other dietary compounds shown to attenuate cyst pathogenesis in animal studies.

The objective of the present study was to further elucidate the mechanisms involved in the wake-promoting effects of psychomotor stimulants. Many previous studies have tightly linked the effects of stimulants to dopamine neurotransmission, and 	some studies	 indicate that serotonin 2A receptors modulate these effects. However, the role of dopamine in arousal is controversial, most notably because dopamine neurons do not change firing rates across arousal states.

We show that C. pneumoniae, an important cause of respiratory infections in humans that additionally is associated with cardiovascular disease, and C. psittaci, an important pathogen in domestic mammals and birds that also infects humans, each enter host cells via cholesterol-rich lipid raft microdomains. Further, we show that C. trachomatis serovars E and F also use these domains to enter host cells. The involvement of these membrane domains in the entry of these organisms was indicated by the sensitivity of their entry to the raft-disrupting agents 	Nystatin	 and filipin, and by their intracellular association with caveolin-1, a 22-kDa protein associated with the formation of caveolae in rafts. In contrast, caveolin-marked lipid raft domains do not mediate entry of C. trachomatis serovars A, 36B, and C, nor of LGV serovar L2 and MoPn. Finally, we show that entry of each of these chlamydial strains is independent of cellular expression of caveolin-1. Thus, entry via the Nystatin and filipin-sensitive pathway is dependent on lipid rafts containing cholesterol, rather than invaginated caveolae per se. DOCEND

In vivo, poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG)-lipid derivatives are employed to stabilize and prolong the circulation lifetime of nucleic acid-containing particles, and to improve targeting strategies. In this study, we have studied the effects of PEG-lipid analogues, i.e. PEG coupled to either phosphatidylethanolamine (	PE	) or ceramide, on cationic-lipid-DNA complex ('lipoplex') assembly and the mechanism of cationic-lipid-mediated delivery of ODNs in vitro. Inclusion of 10 mol% PEG-PE in ODN lipoplexes inhibited their internalization in Chinese hamster ovary cells by more than 70%.

Similar observations were made for complexes prepared from liposomes that contained PEG-ceramides. Interestingly, delivery resumed when lipoplexes had been externally coated with PEG-ceramides. In this case, the kinetics of delivery were dependent on the length of the ceramide acyl chain, consistent with a requirement for the PEG-lipid

Fentanyl, a short-acting synthetic pure opiate, offers an excellent option for the treatment of cancer and chronic pain. While oral administration is not an option, its high potency and lipophilicity have made 	intranasal administration	 feasible. Intranasal fentanyl has a bioavailability of 89%, with a short onset of action ( approximately 7 min) and duration times ( approximately 1 h). It bypasses the oral/gastrointestinal route, delivers the analgesic dose in a volume of 150 microl that can be adequately absorbed and, with a pH of 6.4, avoids local irritation. Intranasal fentanyl has been investigated to assess its potential as a well-tolerated acute postoperative breakthrough pain relief medication.

Primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) is a cholestatic disease associated with autoimmune phenomena and alterations in both biliary bicarbonate excretion and expression of the bicarbonate carrier AE2. The bile acid ursodeoxycholic acid (UCDA) is currently used in treatment of cholestatic liver diseases and is the treatment of choice in PBC; however, a subset of PBC patients respond poorly to UDCA monotherapy. In these patients, a combination of UDCA and glucocorticoid therapy appears to be beneficial. To address the mechanism of this benefit, we analyzed the effects of 	UDCA	 and dexamethasone on AE2 gene expression in human liver cells from hepatocyte and cholangiocyte lineages. The combination of UDCA and dexamethasone, but not UDCA or dexamethasone alone, increased the expression of liver-enriched alternative mRNA isoforms AE2b1 and AE2b2 and enhanced AE2 activity. Similar effects were obtained after replacing UDCA with UDCA conjugates. In in vitro and in vivo reporter assays, we found that a UDCA/dexamethasone combination upregulated human AE2 alternate overlapping promoter sequences from which AE2b1 and AE2b2 are expressed. In chromatin immunoprecipitation assays, we demonstrated that combination UCDA/dexamethasone treatment induced p300-related interactions between HNF1 and glucocorticoid receptor on the

Hypericum LI 160 also inhibits serotonin uptake in neuronal cultures from serotonergic-rich raphe nuclei; concentration-response studies indicate LI 160 is 25 times more potent in terms of inhibition of serotonin uptake in neurons than in astrocytes. In addition, Hypericum LI 160 inhibits norepinephrine uptake in SK-N-SH cells, a human neuroblastoma cell line enriched in norepinephrine transporters. A chemical constituent of LI 160, hyperforin, is about 10 to 20 times more potent than LI 160 in inhibiting neurotransmitter uptake in astrocytes and neuronal cells; this finding is consistent with the observation that hyperforin comprises 5% of LI 160 extracts. As 	several weeks	 are needed to achieve a clinical response with antidepressants, we have also investigated whether Hypericum LI 160 affects biochemical mechanisms that underlie long-term changes such as gene expression. We found that LI 160 stimulates a sustained activation of extracellular signal regulated protein kinase (ERK), a key component of a signal transduction pathway involved in gene expression. Taken together, our findings suggest that Hypericum LI 160 can affect rapidly-acting as well as slower-developing, long-term biochemical mechanisms related to depressive disorders. DOCEND

21105921	T10	ggp	stomatal development regulators FLP/MYB88 in abiotic stress responses. Stomata are vital for the adaptation of plants to abiotic stress, and in turn stomatal density is modulated by environmental factors. Less clear, however, is whether regulators of stomatal development themselves participate in the sensing or response of stomata to abiotic stress. FOUR LIPS (FLP) and its paralog MYB88 encode MYB proteins that establish stomatal patterning by permitting only a single symmetric division before stomata differentiate. Hence, flp-1 myb88 double mutants have an excess of stomata, which are often misplaced in direct contact. Here, we investigate the consequences of loss of FLP/	MYB88	 function on the ability of Arabidopsis plants to respond to abiotic stress. While flp-1 myb88 double mutants are viable and display no obvious aerial phenotypes under normal greenhouse growth conditions, we show that flp-1 myb88 plants are significantly more susceptible to drought and high salt, and have increased rates of water loss. To determine whether flp-1 myb88 plants are already challenged under normal growth conditions, we compared genome-wide transcript levels between flp-1 myb88 and wild-type green tissues. Unexpectedly, uninduced flp-1 myb88 plants showed a reduced accumulation of many typical abiotic stress gene transcripts. Moreover, the induction of many of these

The high SERS detection limit for seawater samples is explained by the competition for PAHs between the sensor membrane and particulate matter surfaces. Thus, the SERS sensor can be applied, e.g., as a non-quantitative alarm sensor for relatively high PAH concentrations in heavily polluted waters. The spectral unmixing procedure applied for Gdansk Harbor water confirmed the presence of phenanthrene at the highest concentration ([Phe]=140 ngl(-1)) and of Chr (2.7 ng l(-1)), but it did not detect the other PAHs present in the Gdansk Harbor water, as determined by GC/MS. When compared to the past literature and 	databases	, the SERS spectra indicated the presence of a mixture of molecules consisting of carotenoids, n-alkanes, amines or fatty acids, and benzimidazoles at the coastal station ZN2. The spectra in the offshore direction indicated carboxylic acids. Interpretation of the farthest offshore in situ SERS measurements is difficult, principally due to the limited availability of reference spectra. The detection of the lower PAH concentrations commonly found in Baltic coastal water needs further research and development to obtain better sensitivity of the SERS sensor.

In the present studies, the pH-sensitive fluorescent dye, bis-(carboxyethyl)-carboxyfluorescein (BCECF) has been used to study pHi changes in suspensions of canine proximal tubule cells following acidification or alkalinization of the cytosol. Cells were acid-loaded to pH 6.5 by exposure to the H+/K+ ionophore, nigericin. Following removal of nigericin, pHi returned to basal levels (pHi = 7.1) when the cells were resuspended in a buffer containing 100 mM Na+. This recovery was blocked by removal of Na+ or addition of 0.2 mM amiloride to the cell suspension. In the presence of 0.2 mM 	amiloride	 and Na+, partial excretion of the acid load occurred if the buffer also contained HCO3-/CO2, but this effect was blocked by the removal of Na+ or the addition of 1 mM 4-acetomido-4'-isothiocyano-2,2'-stilbene disulfonic acid (SITS).

Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a severely disabling anxiety disorder that may occur following exposure to a serious traumatic event. It is a psychiatric condition that can afflict anyone who has experienced a life-threatening or violent event. Previous studies have shown that changes in 18 kDa translocator protein (TSPO) expression (or function), a promising target for treating neurological disorders without benzodiazepine-like side effects, may correlate with PTSD. However, few studies have investigated the anti-PTSD effects of TSPO ligands. 	AC-5216	, a ligand for TSPO, induces anxiolytic- and anti-depressant-like effects in animal models. The present study aimed to determine whether AC-5216 ameliorates PTSD behavior in mice.

EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Western blot analysis and immunohistochemistry methods were used to determine HtrA1 expression in EC cell lines and primary tumors, respectively. Migration, invasion assays and in vivo xenograft experiment were performed to compare the extent of metastasis between HtrA1 expressing and HtrA1 knocked down clones. RESULTS: Western blot analysis of HtrA1 in 13 EC cell lines revealed complete loss of HtrA1 expression in all seven papillary serous EC cell lines. Downregulation of HtrA1 in Hec1A and Hec1B cell lines resulted in a three- to fourfold increase in the invasive potential. Exogenous expression of HtrA1 in 	Ark1	 and Ark2 cells resulted in three- to fourfold decrease in both invasive and migration potential of these cells. There was an increased rate of metastasis to the lungs associated with HtrA1 downregulation in Hec1B cells compared to control cells with endogenous HtrA1 expression. Enhanced expression of HtrA1 in Ark2 cells resulted in significantly less tumor nodules metastasizing to the lungs compared to parental or protease deficient (SA mutant) Ark2 cells. Immunohistochemical analysis showed 57% (105/184) of primary EC tumors had low HtrA1 expression. The association of low HtrA1 expression with high-grade endometrioid tumors was statistically significant (P = 0.016). CONCLUSIONS: Collectively,

Its maximum effect was twice that of hydrochlorothiazide which was associated with a significant kaliuresis. The diuretic effect of CVT-124 was less than that observed with 	furosemide	; however, furosemide administration was associated with a large increase in potassium excretion as well as a reduction in glomerular filtration rate. When given at equinatriuretic doses, CVT-124 enhanced the diuretic and natriuretic activity of furosemide without further increasing potassium excretion. In contrast, the combination of hydrochlorothiazide and furosemide resulted in a 3-fold increase in potassium excretion. These data suggest that CVT-124 possesses unique diuretic activity and, as such, it represents a potential new therapeutic in fluid retaining disorders. In addition, its unique mechanism of action suggests that CVT-124 would be effective in otherwise diuretic-resistant patients. DOCEND

Normally, pancreatic beta cells produce and secrete insulin only in response to increased blood glucose levels. However in many cases, insulin secretion from non-beta cells engineered to produce insulin occurs in a glucose-independent manner. In the present study we engineered liver cells to produce and secrete insulin and insulin secretion can be stimulated via the nitric oxide pathway. RESULTS: Expression of either human insulin or the beta cell specific transcription factors PDX-1, 	NeuroD1	 and MafA in the Hepa1-6 cell line or primary liver cells via adenoviral gene transfer, results in production and secretion of insulin. Although, the secretion of insulin is not significantly increased in response to high glucose, treatment of these engineered liver cells with L-arginine stimulates insulin secretion up to three-fold. This L-arginine-mediated insulin release is dependent on the production of nitric oxide. CONCLUSION: Liver cells can be engineered to produce insulin and insulin secretion can be induced by treatment with L-arginine via the production of nitric oxide. DOCEND

However, IFN-gamma neutralization had no impact on renal dysfunction, suggesting IFN-gamma-independent mechanisms of tissue injury in cisplatin nephrotoxicity. Renal dendritic cells showed high expression of IL-10 in response to cisplatin treatment. We further investigated the effect of dendritic cell-derived IL-10 in cisplatin nephrotoxicity using a conditional cell ablation approach. Mixed bone marrow chimeric mice lacking 	IL-10	 in dendritic cells showed moderately greater renal dysfunction than chimeric mice positive for IL-10 in dendritic cells. These data demonstrate that endogenous IL-10 reduces cisplatin nephrotoxicity and associated inflammation. Moreover, IL-10 produced by dendritic cells themselves accounts for a portion of the protective effect of dendritic cells in cisplatin nephrotoxicity. DOCEND

The levels of cadmium in blood (Cd-B) and nickel in urine (Ni-U) were determined by graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrophotometry. 8-OH-Gua in urine was analyzed using a high performance liquid chromatography-electrochemical detector (HPLC-ECD) system. Data on age, sex, duration of present work and smoking status were also obtained from each subject. Creatinine-adjusted 8-OH-Gua was significantly correlated with age, Ni-U and Cd-B in univariate analysis, while multivariate analysis revealed that Ni-U and Cd-B were significant independent variables and that 	these two biological exposure indices	 were positively correlated with 8-OH-Gua. The data were also analyzed in the context of mixture toxicity. The subjects were divided into groups based on median level of Ni-U and Cd-B (2.86 mug/g creatinine and 0.23 mug/dl, respectively). Workers with high Ni-U/high Cd-B (Group IV) had the highest levels of 8-OH-Gua levels (GM (GSD), 21.7(2.0)), followed by those with high Ni-U/low Cd-B (11.5(1.6) Group III), those with low Ni-U/high Cd-B (8.9(1.9) Group II), and those with low Ni-U/low Cd-B (8.5(1.5) Group I).

As with Dalpha4 and Dalpha6, the Anopheles orthologues are alternatively spliced at equivalent exons. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analysis shows that RNA A-to-I editing sites conserved between Dalpha6 of Drosophila and alpha7-2 of the tobacco budworm, Heliothis virescens, are not shared with the equivalent nAChR subunit of Anopheles. Indeed, RNA-editing sites identified in functionally significant regions of Dbeta1, Dalpha5, and Dalpha6 are not conserved in the mosquito orthologues, indicating considerable divergence of RNA molecules targeted for editing within the insect order Diptera.

In leukocytes, integrins play important roles in adhesive interactions with endothelium, antigen-presenting cells, and effector functions such as cytotoxicity. This chapter describes methods to study Ras proximity 1 (Rap1), a signaling molecule that has been increasingly recognized as an important regulator of integrin-mediated cell adhesion in the immune system as well as hemostasis. 	Rap1	 is activated by a wide variety of external stimuli including chemokines and antigens. Signaling via Rap1 transmits an inside-out signal to the integrins, thereby increasing adhesiveness to ligands such as immunoglobulin superfamily proteins as well as extracellular matrix proteins and plasma proteins. This process induces leukocyte cell adhesion to the endothelium and antigen-presenting cells. In addition to integrin regulation, activated Rap1 induces cell polarity of lymphocytes, which is coordinated with LFA-1 redistribution to the leading edge. DOCEND

The respiratory system has numerous ways to protect lung parenchyma from implantation of bacteria and subsequent infection. Such "natural" defense utilizes the clearing mechanism in the nose, 	larynx	 and upper airways and the cellular and humoral immune factors in the lower respiratory tract so effectively that the host is largely unaware of its tireless surveillance. Normal lungs are kept sterile. In contrast, pneumonitis, which represents the fully developed acute inflammatory reaction, signals the ultimate response to virulent bacteria, but can be considered as general failure of host defense also--depending on your viewpont. In between these extremes are gradations of response, which are unnoticed, perhaps. Thus, the inflammatory response in the lung to bacteria requires initiation, modulation and eventually suppression.

RESULTS: There were 724,584 records; 10.9% of patients had been tested or received blood transfusion at more than one hospital. Of the 63,973 records with RBC alloantibodies, a greater proportion of patients were seen at more than one hospital versus one hospital only (7.11% vs. 3.97%, 	p < 0.005	). Of the 97,687 patient records that required special processing, patients seen at one hospital had a lower rate than those at more than one hospital (12.13% vs. 24.59%, p < 0.005). There were 77 WBITs (0.18 WBITs per 1000 patients). An in-depth review of WBITs found an additional 26.3% (5 of 19) were detected because the current and historical ABO types were from two different hospitals within the CTS.

CGP12177 and L748,337 competed selectively on beta3-ARs because L748,337 had no effect on isoprenaline-induced stimulation of I(Ca,L), while CGP12177 completely blocked the effect of isoprenaline. The activation of beta3-ARs by CGP12177 does not involve the activation of Gi proteins because CGP12177 had no effect on forskolin-induced stimulation of I(Ca,L). CGP12177 had no effect on the force of contraction of 	human	 ventricular trabeculae. L-NMMA, an inhibitor of NO synthase, and IBMX, a nonselective inhibitor of phosphodiesterases, did not potentiate the effect of CGP12177 either on contraction of human ventricular trabeculae or on I(Ca,L) in HVMs. We conclude that in human ventricles beta3-AR activation has no inotropic effect, while it slightly increases I(Ca,L).

An increasing number of reports suggest the involvement of oxidative stress in neurodegenerative diseases where the increased formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) leads to neuronal damage and cell death. Dopamine may contribute to neurodegenerative disorders such as Parkinson's disease and ischemia/reperfusion-induced damage. Monoamine oxidase (MAO) enzyme (particularly MAO-B) is responsible for metabolizing 	dopamine	 and plays an important role in oxidative stress through altering the redox state of neuronal and glial cells. MAO participates in the generation of hydroxyl radicals during ischemia/reperfusion. This suggests the possible use of MAO inhibitors as neuroprotective agents for treating ischemic injury.

However, FAM9C had no significant effects on cell cycle progression when FAM9C was stably overexpressed in Huh-7 cells or knocked down in BEL-7404 cells. Most importantly, FAM9C regulated activation of Akt and UV-induced apoptosis in HCC cells. FAM9C overexpression increased the phosphorylation levels of Akt and anti-apoptotic ability of Huh-7 cells, whereas endogenous 	FAM9C	 knockdown reduced the phosphorylated levels of Akt and anti-apoptotic ability of BEL-7404 cells. Furthermore, the anti-apoptotic function of FAM9C could be prevented when the PI3K-Akt pathway was in a loss-of-function caused by RNA interference against Akt or PI3K inhibitor LY294002 in HCC cells.

PURPOSE: Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) has a potential neuroprotective effect on axotomized retinal ganglion cells (RGCs); however, the mechanism, in regard to intracellular signaling, of BDNF-induced neuroprotection of RGCs is largely unknown. Intracellular signaling was investigated, by using axotomized RGCs and the relative contribution of the two major downstream signaling routes of TrkB determined--that is, mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase (PI3K)-Akt routes, mediated by BDNF. METHODS: 	Neuroprotective effects	 of BDNF were determined by quantifying the surviving RGCs after axotomy, by retrograde labeling. The MAPK and Akt levels were determined by Western blot analysis and activity assays. Quantification of the relative contribution of the two signaling pathways was performed by use of specific inhibitors for MAPK and PI3K (i.e., U0126 and LY294002, respectively).

OBJECTIVE: Fibrosis is excessive scarring caused by the accumulation and contraction of extracellular matrix proteins and is a common end pathway in many chronic diseases, including scleroderma (systemic sclerosis [SSc]). Indeed, pulmonary fibrosis is a major cause of death in SSc. Transforming growth factor beta (TGFbeta) induces endothelin 1 (ET-1) in human lung fibroblasts by a Smad-independent, JNK-dependent mechanism. The goal of this study was to assess whether ET-1 is a downstream mediator of the profibrotic effects of TGFbeta in lung fibroblasts. METHODS: We used a specific endothelin receptor antagonist to determine whether 	ET-1	 is a downstream mediator of TGFbeta responses in lung fibroblasts, using microarray technology, real-time polymerase chain reaction, and Western blot analyses. RESULTS: The ability of TGFbeta to induce the expression of a cohort of profibrotic genes, including type I collagen, fibronectin, and CCN2, and to contract a collagen gel matrix, depends on ET-1. CONCLUSION: ET-1 contributes to the ability of TGFbeta to promote a profibrotic phenotype in human lung fibroblasts, consistent with the notion that endothelin receptor antagonism may be beneficial in controlling fibrogenic responses in lung fibroblasts.

At test doses of 5, 10 and 15 mg/kg p.o., 7-epiclusianone had an anti-inflammatory effect as demonstrated by the reduction of paw oedema induced by carrageenan and the inhibition of leukocyte recruitment into the peritoneal cavity. At the same doses, 7-epiclusianone inhibited nociception induced by an intraperitoneal injection of acetic acid, observed by the decrease in the number of writhing episodes. Additionally, 7-epiclusianone decreased licking time caused by a subplantar injection of formalin. Moreover, the hot plate test produced a significant increase in latency reaction, demonstrating an antinociceptive effect.

16023185	T7	che	DOCSTART Interaction of rapid signal transduction cascades and gene expression in mediating estrogen effects on memory over the life span. Estrogen treatment during middle-age postpones memory impairments, which depend on the hippocampus. However, estrogen responsiveness diminishes with advanced age. The challenge remains to determine, which processes are important for delaying brain aging and the mechanisms for decreased sensitivity. 	Estrogen	 can influence transcription through estrogen receptors (e.g., ERalpha and ERbeta) and membrane effects on rapid signal transduction cascades ultimately influencing the phosphorylation state of transcription factors. In middle-aged animals, the membrane effects involve Ca2+ and G-protein cascades, which rapidly counteract senescent physiology. Moreover, estrogen induces transcription for elements of signal transduction cascades that decline with age. Together, the rapid and genomic influences promote synaptic transmission and cell growth. Thus, interruption of genomic/membrane interactions due to loss of ERs, disruption of the hormone cycle, or uncoupling of the hormone/receptor system associated with extended exposure to estrogen could contribute to a decline
19289169	T52	out	DOCSTART Cerebral ischemia provokes a profound exchange of activated JNK isoforms in brain mitochondria. c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNKs), a family of MAP kinases, are central mediators of apoptosis and neurodegeneration, but also of plasticity and regeneration. Current concepts suggest that the compartmentalisation i.e. the distribution within cellular organelles and structures rather than substrate affinity determines the pathological and physiological function of individual JNKs. In contrast to JNK mediated activation of pro-apoptotic Bcl-2/BH3-only substrates, findings on the 	presence	 and activation of JNK isoforms in mitochondria are rare. Here we have analysed the specific localisation and activation of JNK1, JNK2 and JNK3 as well as of their upstream MKK4/7 in brain mitochondria following transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAo). The mitochondrial preparations were free of cytoskeletal, nuclear and ER contaminations, the specificity of antibodies was demonstrated in brain mitochondria from JNK deficient untreated mice. All JNKs were present in mitochondria with JNK1 as the major carrier of a strong basal JNK activity. Surprisingly, JNK activity was hardly detectable in the remaining cytoplasm.

The cardiac arrhythmic suppression trial (CAST) reported that antiarrhythmic treatments in post-myocardial infarction (MI) patients resulted in poor outcome and decreased in heart rate variability indices (HRV). The goal of the present study was to determine whether aprindine and procainamide, antiarrhythmic agents that increase HRV, result in beneficial effects in post-MI rabbits. Four weeks before experiment, MI was induced in four rabbits by ligating the major branch of left coronary artery. A total of eight rabbits (four post-MI and four normal 	rabbits	) were randomly assigned to treatment with either intravenous aprindine (1 mg/kg) or intravenous procainamide (15 mg/kg). Frequency domain HRV (low frequency spectra, LF, 0.04-0.15 Hz; high frequency spectra, HF, 0.15-0.40 Hz) were assessed by MemCalc software. Aprindine significantly increased HF and LF in both MI and normal rabbits, whereas procainamide tended to decrease HF and LF in MI and normal rabbits (in total rabbits; aprindine, LF, from 6.3 +/- 7.9 to 16.5 +/- 15.0 ms(2)/Hz, P < 0.05; HF, from 8.0 +/- 11.7 to 17.5 +/- 15.0 ms(2)/Hz, P < 0.05; procainamide, LF, from 4.9 +/- 7.4 to 4.8 +/- 8.5 ms(2)/Hz, NS; HF, from 11.1 +/- 23.0 to

DW MRI identified lesions in the posterior limb of the internal capsule (PLIC) in two patients, in the corona radiata (two patients), in the subcortical white matter of the posterior frontal lobe (one patient), and in the frontal and parietal cortex, including the paracentral lobule and precuneus (one patient). The two patients with PLIC infarctions had characteristic linear infarction abnormalities along the long axis of the internal capsule. Corona radiata infarction were located posteriorly, and the two subcortical and cortical infarction were thought to be in the territory of 	the ACA	. We thus concluded that in leg monoparesis due to infarctions, lesions may be located in the PLIC, corona radiata, or in the ACA territory. Recently, magnetic resonance tractography has shown that foot fibres of the corticospinal tract in the PLIC somatotopically may be posteromedial to hand fibres along the short axis of the internal capsule, rather than posterolateral along the long axis as has been thought. Thus, damage along the long axis of the PLIC by linear infarctions can cause pure monoparesis of the leg. DOCEND

Treatment with the calcium chelator EGTA inhibited constitutive as well as HDAC-inhibitor induced MICA/B and ULBP2 cell surface expression on melanoma cells and Jurkat T-cells. A NKG2D-dependent cytolytic assay and staining with a recombinant NKG2D-Fc fusion protein showed that calcium chelation impaired the functional ability of NKG2D-ligands induced by HDAC-inhibitor treatment. The HDAC-inhibitor induced cell surface expression of ULBP2, but not MICA/B, was sensitive to treatment calmidazolium and trifluoperazine, two agents known to block calcium signaling. siRNA-mediated knock-down of the calcium-regulated proteins calmodulin or calpain did however not affect 	NKG2D	-ligand cell surface expression on Jurkat T-cells. We further show that secretion and cell surface binding of the calcium-regulating protein galectin-1 is enhanced upon HDAC-inhibitor treatment of melanoma cells. However, binding of galectin-1 to cell surface glycoproteins was not critical for constitutive or HDAC-inhibitor induced MICA/B and ULBP2 cell surface expression. We provide evidence that MICA/B and ULBP2 cell surface expression is controlled differently by calcium, which adds to the increasing perception that cell surface expression of MICA/B and ULBP2 is controlled by distinct signal transduction pathways.

Cohesive scientific evidence from molecular, animal, and human investigations supports the hypothesis that aberrant induction of COX-2 and up-regulation of the prostaglandin cascade play a significant role in carcinogenesis, and reciprocally, blockade of the process has strong potential for cancer prevention and therapy. Supporting evidence includes the following: [1] expression of constitutive COX-2-catalyzed prostaglandin biosynthesis is induced by most cancer-causing agents including tobacco smoke and its components (polycylic aromatic amines, heterocyclic amines, nitrosamines), essential polyunsaturated fatty acids (unconjugated linoleic acid), mitogens, growth factors, proinflammatory cytokines, microbial agents, tumor promoters, and other epigenetic factors, [2] 	COX-2	 expression is a characteristic feature of all premalignant neoplasms, [3] COX-2 expression is a characteristic feature of all malignant neoplasms, and expression intensifies with stage at detection and cancer progression and metastasis, [4] all essential features of carcinogenesis (mutagenesis, mitogenesis, angiogenesis, reduced apoptosis, metastasis, and immunosuppression) are linked to COX-2-driven prostaglandin (PGE-2) biosynthesis, [5] animal studies show that COX-2 up-regulation (in the absence of genetic mutations) is sufficient to stimulate the transformation of normal cells to invasive cancer and metastatic disease, [6] non-selective COX-2 inhibitors, such as aspirin and ibuprofen, reduce the risk of human cancer and precancerous lesions, and

HCV pseudoparticles infect liver-derived cells, supporting a model in which liver-specific molecules define HCV internalization. Three host cell molecules have been reported to be important entry factors or receptors for HCV internalization: scavenger receptor BI, the tetraspanin CD81, and the tight junction protein claudin-1 (CLDN1). None of the receptors are uniquely expressed within the liver, leading us to hypothesize that their organization within hepatocytes may explain 	receptor activity	. Since CD81 and CLDN1 act as coreceptors during late stages in the entry process, we investigated their association in a variety of cell lines and human liver tissue.

Tyrosine kinase inhibitors prevent Stat5 activation in transfected COS cells. Treatment of recombinant Stat5 with a tyrosine-specific protein phosphatase in vitro abolishes its DNA binding activity. Prolactin stimulation of transfected cells induces Stat5 phosphorylation on tyrosine. Phosphorylation of in vitro transcribed and translated Stat5 with the Jak2 tyrosine kinase, but not with fyn, 	lyn	 or lck, confers DNA binding activity. The prolactin response of the beta-casein milk protein gene promoter can be observed in COS cells transfected with cDNA vectors encoding Stat5 and the long form of the prolactin receptor.

In our study, we examined whether 17-AAG could inhibit PLX4032-enhanced ERK signaling in BRAFWT melanoma cells. As expected, PLX4032 alone enhanced ERK signaling in the BRAFWT melanoma cell lines Mel-Juso, SK-Mel-2, and SK-Mel-30, and inhibited signaling and cell growth in BRAFV600E A375 cells. However, HSP90 inhibition by 	17-AAG	 inhibited PLX4032-enhanced ERK signaling and inhibited cell growth by destabilizing CRAF. Surprisingly, 17-AAG also stimulated melanin production in SK-Mel-30 cells and enhanced TYRP1 and DCT expression without stimulating TYR production in all three BRAFWT cell lines studied as well as in B16F10 mouse melanoma cells. In vivo, the combination of 17-AAG and cellular immunotherapy directed against Tyrp1 enhanced the inhibition of tumor growth compared to either therapy alone.

The smaller blood volume in children compared with adults, even relative to body size, may limit the potential for heat transfer during heat exposure and may compromise exercise performance in the heat.

The lower sweating rate characteristic of children is due to a lower sweating rate per gland and not to a lower number of 	sweat glands	. In fact, children are characterised by a higher density of heat-activated sweat glands. The lower sweating rate per gland may be explained by the smaller sweat gland size, a lower sensitivity of the sweating mechanism to thermal stimuli and, possibly, a lower sweat gland metabolic capacity.

These were all associated with an increased concentration of CRP greater than 50 mg/l, which returned to normal after successful treatment. Thirteen episodes of asymptomatic bacteriuria associated with increased concentrations of CRP greater than 20 mg/l occurred, indicating tissue damage. More commonly, significant bacteriuria was associated with normal concentrations of CRP, and presumably, simple colonisation of the urinary tract, which, we suggest, does not require treatment with antibiotics. Serial measurement of CRP in patients with spinal injury may help distinguish between urinary tract colonisation and infection and be useful in monitoring 	the response	 to the treatment of clinical UTI.

INTRODUCTION: HIV-induced changes in cytokine responses to bacteria may influence susceptibility to bacterial infections and the consequent inflammatory response. METHODS: We examined the impact of HIV on whole blood responsiveness to bacterial stimulation in asymptomatic subjects and patients with bacterial bloodstream infection (BSI). Whole blood was stimulated ex vivo with two bacterial Toll-like receptor agonists (lipopolysaccharide and lipoteichoic acid) and two pathogens (Streptococcus pneumoniae and non-typhoidal Salmonella), which are relevant in HIV-positive patients.

Rats were injected with colchicine, and kidneys were fixed 4-24 h later. In both cortical and medullary IC, proton pumps were localized on vesicles that were scattered throughout the cell. A- and B-type ICs were no longer distinguishable on the basis of proton-pump polarity. In the medulla, no concentration of proton pumps at the basolateral pole of ICs was detectable. In proximal tubules, pumps were also scattered on vesicles throughout the cytoplasm. NEM-sensitive ATPase was reduced by 	over 60%	 in BBMV, and was also reduced in basolateral membranes, indicating no increased insertion of NEM-sensitive ATPase into basolateral membranes after colchicine treatment. We conclude that a change in the polymerization state of microtubules is not sufficient to account for the differential targetting of proton pumps in subpopulations of intercalated cells. DOCEND

Likewise, six 	obesity	 risk groups (OG) were detected, of which four corresponded to the first four high-risk WG groups. The risk groups were relatively independent of race and educational attainment. CONCLUSIONS: Findings of this study imply that five risk groups for weight gain like five consecutive "tests" exist from middle-school period to work-and-family formation. Failure to pass any of these tests in the life course could lead to overweight or obese status. Further research needs to study life-course-specific factors and mechanisms for more effective weight control. DOCEND

We now report the 5-year follow-up of these patients, including RSA of their TM tibial components. PATIENTS AND METHODS: 22 patients (26 knees) received an uncemented TM cruciate-retaining tibial component and 19 patients (21 knees) a cemented NexGen Option cruciate-retaining tibial component. Follow-up with RSA, and clinical and radiographic examinations were done at 5 years. In bilaterally operated patients, the statistical analyses included only the first-operated knee. RESULTS: Both groups had 	most migration	 within the first 3 months, the TM implants to a greater extent than the cemented implants. After 3 months, both groups stabilized and remained stable up to the 5-year follow-up. INTERPRETATION: After a high initial degree of migration, the TM tibia stabilized. This stabilization lasted for at least 5 years, which suggests a good long-term performance regarding fixation. The cemented NexGen CR tibial components showed some migration in the first 3 months and then stabilized up to the 5-year follow-up. This has not been reported previously. DOCEND

We have devised a positive selection procedure that identifies new mutants lacking peroxisomes or peroxisomal function. Immunofluorescence procedures for yeast were simplified so that these mutants could be rapidly and efficiently screened for those in which peroxisome biogenesis is impaired.

Of these, 202 (94%) were interviewed; 197 (91%) underwent visual acuity measurement; and 173 (80%) were examined by a study ophthalmologist. Both in 1970 and in 1985, cases with disciform macular lesions of ocular histoplasmosis had a higher prevalence of both unilateral and bilateral visual impairment and blindness. Although prevalence of 	visual impairment	 and blindness in 1985 was similar among controls and cases of ocular histoplasmosis without disciform lesions, this group of cases had about twice the incidence of visual impairment as that of controls. However, the 95% confidence intervals on estimates of relative risks were broad and included unity. No new disciform lesions attributable to ocular histoplasmosis were found in 28 eyes of 18 cases free of them in 1970 or among 148 controls.

This result was surprising given that nuclear BRAG2 is diffusely distributed throughout the nucleoplasm and is not concentrated within nucleoli at steady state.

Plasma creatine kinase (CK) was assessed before, during, and after the program as a marker of muscle damage. Primary outcome measures were maximum oxygen uptake (VO(2max)) and time in the 5-repetitions-sit-to-stand test (FRSTST).

Here, the controlled conversion of human foetal progenitor cells derived from ventral mesencephalon into dopaminergic neurons is reported. The immunoreactivity to tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and levels of dopamine (DA) and its metabolite, 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC), secreted into culture medium, were used to assess dopaminergic neuronal phenotype. Expansion of the neural progenitor cells for 3 weeks in the presence of basic fibroblast growth factor (2 ng/ml) followed by its withdrawal resulted in approximately 60% of 	cells	 staining positive for TH, when challenged in concert with brain-derived neurotrophic factor (50 ng/ml), DA (10 microM) and forskolin (10 microM) for a further 3 weeks. A corresponding 41-fold increase in DA and DOPAC was measured in the incubation medium by HPLC. Therefore, the successful conversion of human foetal progenitor cells in vitro resulting in the desired dopaminergic neuronal phenotype, could provide a solution to the problem of limited availability of human foetuses for clinical surgical transplantation therapies, which are currently in progress for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's disease.

The aims of this study were to determine which DNM isoforms (DNM1, DNM2, DNM3) are expressed in renal IMCDs, whether DNM interacts with NOS, whether a high-salt diet alters the interaction of DNM and NOS, and whether DNM activates NO production. DNM2 and DNM3 are highly expressed in the rat IMCD, while DNM1 is localized outside of the IMCD. We found that DNM1 interacts with NOS1alpha, NOS1beta, and NOS3 in the inner medulla of male Sprague-Dawley rats on a 0.4% salt diet. DNM2 interacts with NOS1alpha, while DNM3 interacts with both NOS1alpha and NOS1beta. 	DNM2	 and DNM3 do not interact with NOS3 in the rat inner medulla. We did not observe any change in the DNM/NOS interactions with rats on a 4% salt diet after 7 days. Furthermore, NOS1alpha interacts with DNM2 in mIMCD3 and COS7 cells transfected with NOS1alpha and DNM2-GFP constructs and the NOS1 reductase domain is necessary for the interaction. Finally, COS7 cells expressing NOS1alpha or NOS1alpha/DNM2-GFP had significantly higher nitrite production compared with DNM2-GFP only.

We predicted that high-density cues during the larval and adult stages of female 	Pieris rapae	 butterflies lead to lower fecundity but higher conspecific avoidance during oviposition, compared to similar low-density cues. We used a 2x2 factorial design to examine the effects of low and high conspecific density during the larval and adult stages of butterflies on avoidance behavior and fecundity. We found that past information about conspecific density did not matter; all butterflies exhibited similar levels of fecundity and a low level of conspecific avoidance during oviposition regardless of their previous experience as larvae and adults.

The best cut-off point was 280 pg/mL, with a receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.94 (95% confidence interval, 0.91-0.97). Six patients with heart failure diagnosis (	11.5%	) had N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide values <400 pg/mL. Measurement of natriuretic peptides would avoid 67% of requested echocardiograms.

Alterations in the plasma levels of PRL during intermittent as well as continuous infusion with TRH were quite different from those with TSH. Plasma TSH increased following the beginning of a continuous infusion with TRH and reached a peak at approximately 180 min, maintaining a plateau until the infusion was withheld. On 	the other hand	, plasma PRL levels increased rapidly to reach peak levels in 30 min after the start of the infusion gradually following a decline in spite of continued TRH stimulation. Furthermore, a stepwise increase of TSH levels was observed following 4 intermittent injections of TRH; however, plasma PRL rapidly reached peak levels in 30 min following the 1st injection of TRH and a further 3 injections did not raise the levels of PRL.

HCV can infect not only hepatocytes, but also cells of immune system (B-cells, monocytes, macrophages, dendritic cells), epithelium, and immunologically privileged sites such as the central nervous system. Dendritic cells and platelets can also be passive virus carriers. Possibilities of virus clearance or abortive inapparent HCV infection at the stage of adsorption are considered. The second feature is rapid error-prone replication that leads to accumulation within one host of multiple virus variants (quasispecies). Viral heterogeneity could be multiplied by recombination of HCV genomic/subgenomic RNA molecules. Quasispecies nature gives 	virus	 an advantage in adaptation to varying host environment including availability of permissive cells, the presence of innate and adaptive immune response, and antiviral treatment. Analysis of HCV polymorphisms and their evolution rates may pinpoint the molecular (sequence) correlates of HCV clearance. The third feature is the capacity to modify or adapt host milieu. HCV core, envelope E2 and nonstructural NS2, NS3, NS5A proteins seem to hold a grip over the host cellular functions by down-regulating processes unfavorable and up-regulating processes favorable for virus replication and persistence. The relevance of the latter interactions to HCV infection outcome remains to be demonstrated.

It was also discovered that the concentration of cystatin C was increasing along with the length of the disease reaching the highest level in the group of patients suffering from this disease longer than 10 years (0.52+/-0.11 vs. 0.67+/-0.13 vs. 0.93+/-0.13 mg/l), which is again statistically significant.

Regardless of the tissue of origin, most HPV positive (HPV+) cancers show highly upregulated expression of the p16 product of the 	cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2A	 (CDKN2A) gene. Paradoxically, HPV+ tumor cells require continuous expression of this tumor suppressor for survival. Thus, restoration of normal p16 regulation has potential therapeutic value against HPV induced cancers. Normally, p16 transcription is tightly controlled at the epigenetic level via polycomb repressive complex-mediated tri-methylation of histone 3 lysine 27 (H3K27me3). Although a mechanism by which HPV induces p16 has been proposed based on tissue culture models, it has not been extensively validated in human tumors. In this study, we used data from over 800 human cervical and head and neck tumors from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) to test this

METHODS: We used a nested pCS20 PCR and MAP1-B ELISA in a longitudinal study to monitor the onset (age at first infection) and kinetics of E. ruminantium infection and antibody response respectively, in 77 newborn lambs and kids under a traditional husbandry system at three sites (Kerr Seringe, Keneba, Bansang) in The Gambia where heartwater is known to occur. The animals were monitored for field tick infestation and the comparative performance of the two assays in detecting E. ruminantium infection was also assessed. RESULTS: The infection rate detected by 	pCS20 PCR	 varied between 8.6% and 54.8% over the 162-day study period. Nineteen per cent of the animals in week 1 post-partum tested positive by pCS20 PCR with half of these infections (7/14) detected in the first 3 days after birth, suggesting that transmission other than by tick feeding had played a role. The earliest detectable A. variegatum infestation in the animals occurred in week 16 after birth. Antibodies detected by MAP1-B ELISA also varied, between 11.5% and 90%.

In the present study, factors which might affect this process have been examined, in an in vitro system, to test the hypothesis that metabolic depletion of misonidazole could limit its ability to diffuse freely to the hypoxic cell population. Drastic reductions in glucose concentrations from their normal value of 5-10 mM to less than 0.5 mM had no significant effect on the metabolism of either misonidazole or AF-2. Similarly, glucose concentration did not influence the binding of misonidazole, even when concentrations of both oxygen (extreme hypoxia) and glucose were near 	zero--a very toxic biochemical environment	. Similarly, the metabolism of the nitroheterocyclics had no effect on glucose consumption. The bioreductive depletion of misonidazole in extreme hypoxia appeared to be independent of drug concentration between 25 and 100 microM: this nearly zero-order rate of drug metabolism prevented the possibility of working at constant drug concentration. AF-2 exacerbated this effect by greatly enhancing the metabolic depletion of misonidazole. AF-2 was found to increase both the metabolic depletion and binding of misonidazole by the same factor. An unexpected finding was that metabolism of etanidazole, a 2-nitroimidazole closely related to misonidazole, was not enhanced by AF-2. Micromolar amounts of oxygen

INTRODUCTION: Uric acid (UA) increase is considered an important risk factor for the development of cardiovascular disease (CVD) favoring oxidative stress and endothelial dysfunction and is also involved in metabolic syndrome (MS) pathophysiology. AREAS COVERED: Insulin has a physiological action on renal tubules, causing a reduction in UA clearance, what could explain the 	hyperuricemia	 found in MS. On the other hand, it was also hypothesized a causal role of UA in fructose-induced MS. Moreover, it has been suggested that higher UA levels predict the development of MS. MS subjects present a redox imbalance and UA participates in this process. UA can contribute to oxidative stress present in MS; however, it has also an important role in the antioxidant defense system. Although UA may have a protective effect due to its antioxidant properties, it is clear that the dominant effect of UA in MS is deleterious. All-cause mortality and CVD have been shown to be

Brain parenchymal cells have been proposed to be actively involved in the pathogenesis of murine cerebral malaria. We, therefore, compared the neurochemical characteristics of Plasmodium berghei ANKA-infected mice with controls to determine whether cerebral malarial infection significantly impairs specific neuronal populations. Between 6 and 7 days after infection, we found a significant loss of neurones containing substance P, with 	preservation	 of cells containing somatostatin, neuropeptide Y and calbindin in the striatum of infected mice compared with controls. In the cortex of infected mice, we found a significant reduction in the number of cells containing substance P, somatostatin and neuropeptide Y. The number of calbindin-containing neurones was unchanged. This study found significant changes in the neurochemical characteristics of the cortex and striatum of mice infected with P. berghei ANKA, which may contribute to their cerebral symptoms. DOCEND

Deficient selection against irrelevant information has been proposed to underlie age-related cognitive decline. We recently reported evidence for maintained early sensory selection when older and younger adults used spatial selective attention to perform a challenging task. Here we explored age-related differences when spatial selection is not possible and feature-selective attention must be deployed. We additionally compared the integrity of feedforward processing by exploiting the well established phenomenon of suppression of visual cortical responses attributable to interstimulus competition. Electroencephalogram was measured while older and younger 	human	 adults responded to brief occurrences of coherent motion in an attended stimulus composed of randomly moving, orientation-defined, flickering bars. Attention was directed to horizontal or vertical bars by a pretrial cue, after which two orthogonally oriented, overlapping stimuli or a single stimulus were presented. Horizontal and vertical bars flickered at different frequencies and thereby elicited separable steady-state visual-evoked potentials, which were used to examine the effect of feature-based selection and the competitive influence of a second stimulus on ongoing visual processing. Age differences were found in feature-selective attentional modulation of visual responses: older adults did not show consistent modulation of

However, NEP did not significantly decrease the amount of rhIL-1 beta assessed by the growth inhibitory activity of a human melanoma, by the immunoassay, or by the direct analysis on HPLC. Therefore, we conclude that NEP does not significantly hydrolyze rhIL-1 beta. Our results suggest that, in contrast to the regulatory role of NEP in neuropeptide-induced responses, 	NEP	 is not a regulatory enzyme for IL-1-induced responses. DOCEND

Amongst 149 cases of reflex sympathetic dystrophy syndrome (RSDS), 25 (16.8%) were being treated with barbiturates at the time the RSDS symptoms began. This group is unusual by the frequent absence of provocative events (32%), a high number of diseased joints, bilaterality (76%), 	involvement	 of upper limbs (76%) and Dupuytren's disease (52%). Swift and complete recovery depends mostly on barbiturate withdrawal. These data support the idea that barbiturates may be the principal initiating event in some RSDS.

Human natural killer (NK) cells are one major component of lymphocytes that mediate early protection against viruses and tumor cells, and play an important role in immune regulatory functions.

Phenotypic analysis of NK cell subsets indicated that the expression of activation markers, adhesion molecules, memory cell markers, inhibitory and activating receptors, and intracellular proteins (	granzyme B	 and perforin) were heterogeneous. Following interleukin (IL)-2 stimulation, interferon-gamma was preferentially produced by CD56+CD16(-) NK cells and this subset showed more proliferative capacity. The cytolytic activity of both CD56+CD16(-) and CD56+/-CD16+ subsets could be augmented in response to IL-2.

OPZ increased the mRNA expression of both Cyp2b10 and Nqo1 in C57BL/6 mouse livers. As expected, in livers from Nrf2-/- mice, OPZ induction of Nqo1 was reduced, indicating Nqo1 induction is dependent on Nrf2 activation, whereas Cyp2b10 induction was unchanged. The robust induction of Cyp2b10 by OPZ in wild-type 	mice	 was completely absent in CAR-/- mice, revealing a CAR-dependent induction by OPZ. OPZ also induced transcription of the human CYP2B6 promoter-reporter containing the phenobarbital (PB) responsive element in mouse liver using an in vivo transcription assay. Additionally, OPZ induced in vivo nuclear accumulation of CAR at 3 h but, as with PB, was unable to reverse androstanol repression of mouse CAR constitutive activity in transiently transfected HepG2 cells.

The patients had a high prevalence of maternal inheritance of diabetes and deafness, short and thin stature, and showed an early middle-aged onset of diabetes and deafness. Eighty-six percent of the patients required insulin therapy due to the progressive insulin secretory defect. Glucose intolerance of the mothers was associated with an early middle-aged onset of diabetes, reduction in the insulin secretory capacity, early requirement of insulin therapy, and increases in the daily insulin dose. The heteroplasmic concentrations of the 3243 mutation in 	leukocytes	 were low and declined with aging. The patients had advanced microvascular complications, and mitochondria-related complications such as cardiomyopathy, cardiac conductance disorders, neuromuscular symptoms, neuropsychiatric disturbance, and macular pattern dystrophy.

The separation of samples into two phases upon reduction is discussed on the basis of a short-range inhomogeneous distribution of iron and 	ruthenium	 in the starting materials. X-ray absorption data and Mossbauer spectra reveal the reduced samples contain an Fe(3+) and Ru(2+/3+) oxidation state combination, which is unexpected considering the Fe(3+)/Fe(2+) and Ru(3+)/Ru(2+) redox potentials, suggesting that the local coordination geometry of the transition metal sites helps to stabilize the Ru(2+) centers.

RESULTS: The search yielded 2032 publications on pemphigus during the evaluation period. Sixty-one per cent were published in dermatology journals. Overall, the number of publications increased linearly with time. Most of this increase was accounted for by publications in 	non-dermatology journals	.

Subsequently, the m7G-cap is hypermethylated to the 2,2,7-trimethylguanosine (m3G)-cap. The import adaptor snurportin1 recognises the m3G-cap and facilitates the nuclear import of the UsnRNPs by binding to importin-beta. Here we report the crystal structure of the m3G-cap-binding domain of snurportin1 with bound m3GpppG at 2.4 A resolution, revealing a structural similarity to the mRNA-guanyly-transferase. 	Snurportin1	 binds both the hypermethylated cap and the first nucleotide of the RNA in a stacked conformation. This binding mode differs significantly from that of the m7G-cap-binding proteins Cap-binding protein 20 (CBP20), eukaryotic initiation factor 4E (eIF4E) and viral protein 39 (VP39). The specificity of the m3G-cap recognition by snurportin1 was evaluated by fluorescence spectroscopy, demonstrating the importance of a highly solvent exposed tryptophan for the discrimination of m7G-capped RNAs. The critical role of this tryptophan and as well of a tryptophan continuing the RNA base stack was confirmed by nuclear import assays and cap-binding activity tests using several snurportin1 mutants.

Novel therapeutic methods, particularly molecular targeted therapy, have attracted considerable attention. MicroRNAs (miRs) are reported to be potential biomarkers and targeted agents with roles in various types of tumors. Herein, the present study presented the observation of aberrant low expression of miR-29c and associated overexpression of vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA) in NSCLC tumor tissues. The effects of miR-29c upon NSCLC tumor progression, including cell proliferation and cellular apoptosis, were investigated. The possible regulatory mechanism of action of 	miR-29c	 on its direct target VEGFA and the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/RAC-alpha serine/threonine-protein kinase (Akt) signaling pathway was examined using multiple methods, including reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis, dual luciferase assay and western blot analysis. The results demonstrated that miR-29c expression was downregulated in NSCLC tumor tissues compared with normal tissues. A marked negative correlation in the expression of miR-29c and VEGFA was observed in clinical NSCLC tissues and cultured NSCLC cells.

In a previous double-blind randomized study, we have shown that the diuretic NKCC1 chloride importer antagonist 	bumetanide	, that decreases (Cl-)i and reinforces GABAergic inhibition, reduces the severity of autism symptoms. Here, we report results from an open-label trial pilot study in which we used functional magnetic resonance imaging and neuropsychological testing to determine the effects of 10 months bumetanide treatment in adolescents and young adults with autism. We show that bumetanide treatment improves emotion recognition and enhances the activation of brain regions involved in social and emotional perception during the perception of emotional faces.

PURPOSE: Obesity is a significant risk factor for renal cell carcinoma. The adipocyte derived cytokine leptin, which controls body weight homeostasis through food intake and energy expenditure, recently provided a potential link between obesity and cancer development. We examined whether leptin promotes the invasiveness of renal cancer cells and we investigated its underlying signaling pathway. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Leptin receptor expression in the 6 human renal cancer cell lines Caki-1, ACHN, 769P, A498, SKRC44 and 	SKRC49	, and in the murine renal cancer cell line Renca was examined by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and Western blotting. The effect of leptin on renal cancer cell invasiveness was assessed by the invasion of cells through Matrigel coated Transwell inserts. Leptin induced intracellular signaling was examined by Western blotting. RESULTS: Leptin receptor was detected in all renal cancer cells examined at the mRNA and protein levels. Leptin increased Renca cell invasiveness at 1 ng/ml (p < 0.05). There was up to 3-fold invasiveness compared to untreated cells at 100 ng/ml with the activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinases and rho guanosine triphosphatase

The age-related decline in lymphocyte development and function coincides with impaired zinc status in the elderly.

Thus, compromised zinc status associated with aging may be an important contributing factor in 	reduced thymopoiesis	 and impaired immune functions. Our goal in this study was to understand how dietary zinc supplementation affects thymopoiesis in aged mice. We hypothesized that impaired zinc status associated with aging would mediate the decline in thymic function and output and that restoring plasma zinc concentrations via zinc supplementation would improve thymopoiesis and thymic functions. In this study, groups of young (8 wk) and aged (22 mo) mice were fed a zinc-adequate (30 mg/kg zinc) or zinc-supplemented diet (300 mg/kg) for 25 d.

Glycogen synthase kinase (GSK)-3beta is a constitutively active, proline-directed serine/threonine kinase that controls growth modulation and tumorigenesis through multiple intracellular signaling pathways. How GSK-3beta regulates signaling pathways induced by cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF) is poorly understood. In this study, we used fibroblasts derived from GSK-3beta gene-deleted mice to understand 	the role	 of this kinase in TNF signaling. TNF induced NF-kappaB activation as measured by DNA binding in wild-type mouse embryonic fibroblasts, but deletion of GSK-3beta abolished this activation. This inhibition was due to suppression of IkappaBalpha kinase activation and IkappaBalpha phosphorylation, ubiquitination, and degradation. TNF-induced NF-kappaB reporter gene transcription was also suppressed in GSK-3beta gene-deleted cells. NF-kappaB activation induced by lipopolysaccharide, interleukin-1beta, or cigarette smoke condensate was completely suppressed in GSK-3beta(-/-) cells. Deletion of GSK-3beta also abolished TNF-induced c-Jun N-terminal kinase and p44/p42 mitogen-activated kinase activation. Most surprisingly, TNF-induced Akt activation also required the presence of GSK-3beta. TNF induced expression of

Thus, the total response from B cells in 2-deoxy-2-fluoroglucose during a 30-min stimulation with glucose and leucine was significantly higher (1.6- and 1.9-fold respectively) than that from B cells in 5.5 mM glucose, although there was no significant difference in insulin secretion evoked by 2-ketoisocaproate. Furthermore, in the former B cells, the amount of insulin secreted during the second phase was 84-94% of the total insulin secretion, and in the latter it was 	66-76%	. Addition of 1 mM 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine and 10 microM forskolin resulted in a significant increase in insulin secretion by B cells in 2-deoxy-2-fluoroglucose, whereas there was no difference in the increase of insulin secretion induced by 16.7 mM glucose and 200 nM 12-o-tetradecanoyl phorbol-13-acetate. In monolayer cultures that had been maintained in both media for 15 days, the second phase of insulin secretion due to the secretagogues was slightly decreased, but the biphasicity in the response was well preserved. In conclusion, the present results suggest that B cells of 3-week-old rats may be still immature, and that the medium with 2-deoxy-2-fluoroglucose

A comprehensive experimental approach was used encompassing biochemical techniques, single molecule microscopy, correlative confocal and scanning electron microscopy, morphometry of cellular extensions, live-cell imaging and tracking, transplantation onto organotypic brain slices, two-photon imaging and invasion assays. We found that CD44-GFP fusion protein was localized in filopodia and in focal bleb-like protrusions where it provided 	binding sites	 for hyaluronan. Transient expression of CD44-GFP was sufficient to increase the length of filopodia, to enhance cell migration and to promote invasive growth into hyaluronan-rich brain tissue. Thus, CD44 controls molecular devices localized in filopodia and bleb-like specializations of the cell surface that enhance cell migration and invasive growth. DOCEND

Cysteine oxidation of the two RNA recognition motifs (RRM1 and RRM2) of TDP-43, a multi-domain protein involved in neurodegenerative diseases, results in loss of function and accumulation of insoluble aggregates under both in vitro and in vivo conditions. However, the molecular mechanisms linking cysteine oxidation to protein aggregation and functional aberration remain unknown. We report that oxidation of cysteines in RRM1, but not in other domains, induced conformational changes which subsequently resulted in protein aggregation and loss of nucleic acid-binding activity. Thus, oxidation-induced conformational change of 	RRM1	 plays a key role in TDP-43 aggregation and disease progression. DOCEND

We describe here the identification of the penton base gene of hemorrhagic enteritis virus (HEV), a type II avian adenovirus, in a 2477-base pair (bp)-EcoRI fragment of the viral DNA by sequence analysis. Identification is based on an extensive amino acid homology between the HEV-open reading frame and the penton base of a fowl adenovirus (FAV-10) and various human adenoviruses. The 1344 bp-penton base gene of HEV encodes a 448-amino acid polypeptide of molecular weight of 50,843 Da. The nucleotide sequences of penton base genes of 	HEV	 and marble spleen disease virus (MSDV) are identical. The HEV penton base lacks the RGD motif, present in most human adenoviruses (Ad2, Ad3, Ad4, and Ad 12) suggesting that HEV may not use alpha v integrins to gain entry into host cells. Further sequence analysis revealed the presence of a Leu-Asp-Val (LDV) motif in the HEV penton base amino acid sequence similar to most of the human adenoviruses. LDV motif on the fibronectin has been shown to interact with the alpha 4 beta 1 integrins on cells, which includes lymphocytes and monocytes. The presence of LDV motif in the penton

During 	a recent 20-month period (August 2003-March 2005)	, all patients receiving elective endovascular repair of an AAA underwent computer-generated computed tomographic measurements, including suprarenal aortic diameter (D1) and maximum aneurysm diameter (D3). As a measure of proportional dilatation, a D3/D1 ratio was calculated for each patient and compared between genders. Values for males and females were plotted separately (D3 vs. D3/D1), and the resulting linear regression equations allowed for the comparison of proportional dilatation of aneurysms between genders. In 129 patients (108 males, 21 females), mean D3 did not differ between genders (62 +/- 9.0 vs 63.4 +/- 10.8 mm, p = 0.89), while relative dilatation (D3/D1) was significantly greater in

The ectodomain of gp41 (s-gp41) was secreted from the methylotrophic yeast Pichia pastoris and purified by immunoaffinity chromatography. Enzymatic deglycosylation of the recombinant s-gp41 was necessary to allow its in vitro interaction with C1q. A solid-phase competition assay was used to monitor the effect of mutant peptides derived from segment 601-613 of gp41 on the binding of deglycosylated s-gp41 to C1q. Whereas mutation of Ser606 had no effect, replacement of Ile602, Trp603, Lys608, Leu609 and Ile610 by Ala abolished 	the ability	 of the resulting peptides to inhibit binding of s-gp41 to C1q, suggesting that these residues participate in the interaction between gp41 and C1q. These findings are discussed in the light of a structural model of the immunodominant loop of gp41. It is proposed that the recognition of gp41 by C1q is driven by hydrophobic interactions, and that the sites of gp41 responsible for interaction with gp120 and C1q partly overlap. DOCEND

Nucleosomes at the GRU occupy multiple frames that are remodeled without nucleosome repositioning, showing that nucleosome positioning is not the key determinant of chromatin accessibility at this locus. Remodeling affects nucleosomes and adjacent linker sequences, enhancing accessibility at both regions. This is associated with decreased interaction of both the linker histone H1 and the core histone H3 with 	DNA	. Thus, our results indicate that nucleosome and linker histone removal rather than nucleosome repositioning is associated with GR-triggered accessibility. Interestingly, GR induces hyperacetylation of histones H3 and H4, but this is not sufficient either for remodeling or for transcriptional activation.

Recent evidence has identified the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator-1alpha (PGC-1alpha) as a regulator of cardiac energy metabolism and mitochondrial biogenesis. We describe the development of a transgenic system that permits inducible, cardiac-specific overexpression of PGC-1alpha. Expression of the PGC-1alpha transgene in this system (tet-on PGC-1alpha) is cardiac-specific in the presence of doxycycline (dox) and is not leaky in the absence of dox. Overexpression of PGC-1alpha in tet-on 	PGC-1alpha	 mice during the neonatal stages leads to a dramatic increase in cardiac mitochondrial number and size coincident with upregulation of gene markers associated with mitochondrial biogenesis. In contrast, overexpression of PGC-1alpha in the hearts of adult mice leads to a modest increase in mitochondrial number, derangements of mitochondrial ultrastructure, and development of cardiomyopathy. The cardiomyopathy in adult tet-on PGC-1alpha mice is characterized by an increase in ventricular mass and chamber dilatation.

Bacterial biofilms are associated with persistent infections because they are highly tolerant of antimicrobial agents, and in the case of Staphylococcus aureus, which is a leading cause of nosocomial infections because of its resistance to diverse antibiotics, biofilm formation is a known mechanism of drug resistance. In the present study, we investigated the ability of thermoresponsive oligo (N-vinylcaprolactam) (OVCL) to control biofilm formation by and the virulence of 	S. aureus	. One synthetic and four commercial OVCLs (MW <= 240,000) at 50 microg/mL were found to increase S. aureus biofilm formation 7-fold at 25 degrees C, but to markedly inhibit S. aureus biofilm formation at 37 degrees C. Confocal and scanning electron microscopy confirmed the temperature-dependent effect of OVCL on S. aureus biofilms. It was found that the addition of OVCL to S. aureus culture caused cells to become dramatically more hydrophilic at 37 degrees C, which partially supports the biofilm reduction. Also, transcriptional analysis showed that OVCL temperature-dependently regulated biofilm-related genes (aur, agrA, and icaA) in S. aureus. In addition, it

Previous experimental and theoretical modeling studies have indicated that folate cofactors are limiting for cytoplasmic folate-dependent reactions and that the synthesis of DNA precursors competes with SAM synthesis. Each of these studies concluded that SAM synthesis has a higher metabolic priority than dTMP synthesis. The influence of cytoplasmic serine hydroxymethyltransferase (cSHMT) on this competition was examined in MCF-7 cells. Increases in cSHMT expression inhibit SAM concentrations by two proposed mechanisms: (1) cSHMT-catalyzed serine synthesis competes with the enzyme methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase for methylenetetrahydrofolate in a glycine-dependent manner, and (2) cSHMT, a high affinity 	5-methyltetrahydrofolate	-binding protein, sequesters this cofactor and inhibits methionine synthesis in a glycine-independent manner. Stable isotope tracer studies indicate that cSHMT plays an important role in mediating the flux of one-carbon units between dTMP and SAM syntheses. We conclude that cSHMT has three important functions in the cytoplasm: (1) it preferentially supplies one-carbon units for thymidylate biosynthesis, (2) it depletes methylenetetrahydrofolate pools for SAM synthesis by synthesizing serine, and (3) it sequesters 5-methyltetrahydrofolate and inhibits SAM synthesis. These results indicate that cSHMT is a metabolic switch that, when activated, gives dTMP synthesis higher metabolic priority than SAM synthesis. DOCEND

Dopamine oxidation by *NO increased with pH, and occurred at modest levels at pH 5.5. In spite of this, calculations showed that the oxidation of dopamine in the storage vesicles (pH 5.5) was higher than that in the cytosol (pH 7.4), due to the higher dopamine concentration in the storage vesicles (millimolar range) compared to that in the cytosol (micromolar range). It is suggested that storage vesicles may be the cellular sites where the potential for dopamine oxidation by *NO is higher. 	These data	 provide further support to the hypothesis that dopamine renders dopaminergic cells more susceptible to the mitochondrial damaging effects of *NO. In the early stages of Parkinson's disease, *NO production increases until reaching a point near the threshold level that induces neuronal damage. Dopamine stored in dopaminergic cells may cause these cells to be more susceptible to the deleterious effects of *NO, which involve irreversible impairment of mitochondrial respiration. DOCEND

Also it reviews the diagnosis and the relationship between autoimmune thyroid disease, neoplasm, and kidney disorders. Recent Findings. Autoimmune thyroid diseases have been reported in people living in different parts of the world including North America, Europe, Baalkans, Asia, Middle East, South America, and Africa though the reported figures do not fully reflect the number of people infected per 	year	. Cases are unrecognized due to inaccurate diagnosis and hence are treated as other diseases.

Specificity of these sites to the Egr-1 and KLF4 protein was confirmed by electrophoretic mobility shift and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays. Resveratrol increased Egr-1 and KLF4 expression, which preceded ATF3 expression, and further suggests Egr-1 and KLF4 involvement in resveratrol-mediated activity. We provide evidence for Egr-1 and KLF4 interaction in the presence of 	resveratrol	, which may facilitate ATF3 transcriptional regulation by this compound. Furthermore, we demonstrate that induction of apoptosis by resveratrol is mediated, in part, by increased ATF3 expression. Taken together, these results provide a novel mechanism by which resveratrol induces ATF3 expression and represent an additional explanation of how resveratrol exerts its antitumorigenic effects in human colorectal cancer cells.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We evaluated the feasibility of using an implantable impedance measuring device and cardiac lead system to monitor intrathoracic congestion in a pacing-induced heart failure canine model. Three devices were implanted in each of five dogs: a modified pacemaker to measure impedance from a defibrillation lead implanted in the right ventricle; an implantable hemodynamic monitoring device to measure left ventricular end diastolic pressure (LVEDP) and a second pacemaker to deliver rapid (240 pulses per minute) ventricular pacing to induce heart failure.

24085819	T48	out	DOCSTART Melanocortin 4 receptor becomes an ACTH receptor by coexpression of melanocortin receptor accessory protein 2. Melanocortin 2 receptor (MC2R) is the only canonical ACTH receptor. Its functional expression requires the presence of an accessory protein, known as melanocortin receptor 2 accessory protein 1 (MRAP1). The vertebrate genome exhibits a paralogue gene called MRAP2, which is duplicated in zebrafish (MRAP2a and MRAP2b), although its function remains unknown. In this paper, we demonstrate that MRAP2a enables MC4R, a canonical MSH receptor, to be activated by ACTH with 	a similar sensitivity	 to that exhibited by MC2R. Both proteins physically interact and are coexpressed in the neurons of the preoptic area, a key region in the control of the energy balance and hypophyseal secretion in fish. ACTH injections inhibit food intake in wild-type zebrafish but not in fish lacking functional MC4R. Both MRAP1 and MRAP2a are hormonally regulated, suggesting that these proteins are substrates for feed-back regulatory pathways of melanocortin signaling. Fasting has no effect on the central expression of MRAP2a but stimulates MRAP2b expression. This protein interacts and is colocalized with MC4R in the tuberal hypothalamic neurons but has no effect

To differentiate between a sodium-coupled (SGLT1) and diffusive (GLUT2) route of entry, fluxes were measured in the presence of the SGLT1 and GLUT2 inhibitors phloridzin and phloretin. Glucose transporter mRNA levels were measured by reverse transcriptase-PCR, and localization by Western blotting. Surface-expressed GLUT2 was assessed by luminal biotinylation. Activation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase was analysed by Western blotting. We found that treatment of jejunal tissue with AICAR resulted in enhanced net glucose uptake and was associated with phosphorylation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase. Inhibition of p38 abrogated the stimulation of AICAR-stimulated glucose uptake. 	Phloretin	 abolished the AICAR-mediated increase in glucose flux, whereas phloridzin had no effect, suggesting the involvement of GLUT2. In addition, AICAR decreased total protein levels of SGLT1, concurrently increasing levels of GLUT2 in the brush-border membrane. The anti-diabetic drug metformin, a known activator of AMPK, also induced the localization of GLUT2 to the luminal surface. We conclude that the activation of AMPK results in an up-regulation of non-energy requiring glucose uptake by GLUT2 and a concurrent down-regulation of sodium-dependent glucose transport. DOCEND

We determined plasma cGMP and carotid artery intima-media thickness (IMT) and diameter in 84 asymptomatic men submitted to 	investigation	 of their cardiovascular risk profiles. Plasma cGMP was positively associated with IMT (P<0.01) and diameter (P<0.05), independently of coexisting risk factors. These associations were reinforced in the subgroup of subjects with high-sensitivity C-reactive protein level or multiple atherosclerotic plaques. A positive relationship existed between diameter and IMT (P<0.01) and disappeared after cGMP adjustment. This suggests a link between cGMP pathway and arterial wall geometry that is revealed by vascular injury conditions and may participate in early large artery remodeling. DOCEND

Sera obtained from 2 groups of badgers removed in bovine tuberculosis control operations have been examined for antibodies to 11 species of mycobacteria. From animals without post mortem evidence of tuberculosis, levels of antibodies to mycobacteria were found to increase with age, and different patterns of antibodies were found in animals coming from 2 different places. Some animals (5 out of 60) without evidence of progressive infection had antibodies suggesting contact with tubercle bacilli. Animals found to have 	tuberculosis	 at post mortem had increased levels of antibody to common mycobacterial antigen, as do humans with that disease. Only 2 of the 12 tuberculous animals had markedly more antibody binding to Tuberculin than to the other reagents. There was no evidence of greater specificity of antibody binding than was shown by sera of healthy badgers. The suggestion is made that contact with environmental mycobacteria might be a major factor determining distribution of tuberculosis amongst badgers. DOCEND

The growth factor-inducible COX-2, which is overexpressed in neoplastic colonic tissue, is an attractive target to mediate this effect. Herein we have exploited the ability of a human colon cancer cell line, HCA-7 Colony 29, to polarize when cultured on Transwell (Costar) filters to study COX-2 production and the vectorial release of prostaglandins (PGs). Administration of type alpha transforming growth factor to the basolateral compartment, in which the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) resides, results in a marked induction of COX-2 immunoreactivity at the base of the cells and 	the unexpected appearance	 of COX-2 in the nucleus. The increase in COX-2 protein is associated with a dose- and time-dependent increase in PG levels in the basolateral, but not apical, medium. Amphiregulin is the most abundantly expressed EGFR ligand in these cells, and the protein is present at the basolateral surface. EGFR blockade reduces baseline COX-2 immunoreactivity, PG levels, and mitogenesis in a concentration-dependent manner. Two specific COX-2 inhibitors, SC-58125 and NS 398, also, in a dose-dependent manner, attenuate baseline and type alpha transforming growth factor-stimulated mitogenesis, although PG levels are decreased > 90% at all concentrations of inhibitor tested.

During pregnancy in the rat, there is a change in the ability of chlorophenylthio (CPT)-cAMP to inhibit myometrial phosphatidylinositide turnover. This is accompanied by a change in the association of proteins with a plasma membrane A kinase anchoring protein (AKAP). Both CPT-cAMP and isoproterenol inhibited oxytocin-stimulated phosphatidylinositide turnover on days 12 through 20 of gestation, whereas neither agent had an effect on day 21. Accompanying this change was a dramatic decrease in the concentration and activity of 	cAMP	-dependent protein kinase [protein kinase A (PKA)] and an increase in the concentration of protein phosphatase 2B (PP2B) in plasma membranes from day 21 compared with day 19 pregnant rats. In contrast, both PKA and PP2B concentrations and activities increased in total myometrial homogenates. Both PKA and PP2B coimmunoprecipitated with an antibody against the 150-kDa AKAP found in rat myometrial plasma membranes.

Based on patterns of genetic structure previously found, we explicitly tested whether adults of the sheep tick 	Ixodes ricinus	 pair according to their genetic relatedness. We sampled tick pairs from the vegetation in four natural populations and genotyped individual ticks at seven microsatellite loci. Based on this data, we observed highly significant assortative mating in two of the four locations, a pattern that could not be accounted for by a spatial autocorrelation in the distribution of related ticks. One explanation for these observations may be the existence of local host associations that develop independently in different populations.

At 38 or 39 days, total in vitro binding of [3H]SCH-23390 and [3H]spiroperidol to striatal homogenates was not altered in any of the groups.

BACKGROUND: It has been suggested that patients with nephrotic syndrome (NS) have an increased frequency of cardiovascular risk factors. The aim of this study was to determine the frequency of cardiovascular risk factors in children with primary NS. METHODS: Cross-sectional, descriptive and prospective study. Fifty-five patients with primary NS were included. The presence of overweight/	obesity	, hypertension, dyslipidemias, hyperglycemia, elevated C-reactive protein and carotid intima-media thickness (IMT) was evaluated. The treatment time, the type of treatment and the number of relapses were analyzed. For statistical analysis chi-square and Spearman's rho were used. RESULTS: The most frequent cardiovascular risk factor was increased carotid IMT (98.1 %), followed by hypertriglyceridemia (54.4 %) and total cholesterol (40 %). Patients with corticosensitive NS had fewer risk factors compared with patients with steroid-resistant NS. There was also a positive correlation of longer time of evolution and number of relapses with the increase in the number of factors. CONCLUSIONS: Ninety-eight percent of children with primary

Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition and/or blocking of the angiotensin II receptor are recognized as first line treatment for nephropathy and cardiovascular disease in diabetes patients. A new class of drug in late stages of development is vasopeptidase inhibitors. This drug inhibits both angiotensin converting enzyme activity and neutral endopeptidase. Neutral endopeptidase is a protease that degrades a number of biologically active peptides including vasoactive peptides. However, little information is available about the potential benefits of these drugs on diabetic neuropathy. Pre-clinical studies suggest that 	these drugs	 may be useful in treating diabetic complications involving vascular tissue. The purpose of this review is to evaluate the use of angiotensin converting enzyme and vasopeptidase inhibitors in the treatment of diabetic neuropathy. DOCEND

18227305	T23	out	DOCSTART A presenilin-1 mutation renders neurons vulnerable to isoflurane toxicity. BACKGROUND: Isoflurane, a commonly used inhaled anesthetic, induces apoptosis in rat pheochromocytoma neurosecretory cells (PC12) in a concentration- and time-dependent manner via an as yet unknown mechanism. We hypothesize that isoflurane induces 	apoptosis	 by causing abnormal calcium release from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) via activation of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) receptors. A presenilin-1 (PS1) mutation associated with familial Alzheimer's disease was shown to increase the activity of IP3 receptors, and therefore may render cells vulnerable to isoflurane-induced cytotoxicity. Sevoflurane and desflurane have less ability to disrupt intracellular calcium homeostasis; and thus we predict they will cause less cytotoxicity. METHODS: PC12 cells transfected with wild type, vector alone (Vector) or mutated PS1 (L286V) were treated with equivalent of 1 MAC of isoflurane, sevoflurane, and desflurane for 12 h.

The growth of human melanoma cells FO-1 in nude mice is strongly inhibited or even abrogated when the cells are stably transfected with a plasmid expressing an antisense RNA to the 	insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor	 (IGF-1R) RNA, which causes a marked reduction in the number of IGF-1 receptors. When a tumor arises after a long delay in nude mice, it can be shown that the tumor cells have lost the expression plasmid and that the number of IGF-1 receptors has returned to wild-type levels. The antisense effect is even more remarkable, since the growth of FO-1 melanoma cells in monolayers is not affected by the expression of the antisense RNA. Inhibition of tumorigenesis was also evident when FO-1 melanoma cells were treated with antisense oligodeoxynucleotides to the IGF-1R RNA prior to injection into nude mice.

BMS-599626 abrogated HER1 and HER2 signaling and inhibited the proliferation of tumor cell lines that are dependent on these receptors, with IC50 in the range of 0.24 to 1 micromol/L. BMS-599626 was highly selective for tumor cells that depend on HER1/HER2 and had no effect on the proliferation of cell lines that do not express these receptors. In tumor cells that are capable of forming HER1/HER2 heterodimers, BMS-599626 inhibited heterodimerization and downstream signaling. BMS-599626 had antitumor activity in models that overexpress 	HER1	 (GEO), as well as in models that have HER2 gene amplification (KPL4) or overexpression (Sal2), and there was good correlation between the inhibition of receptor signaling and antitumor activity. CONCLUSIONS: BMS-599626 is a highly selective and potent inhibitor of HER1 and HER2 kinases and inhibits tumor cell proliferation through modulation of receptor signaling. BMS-599626 inhibits HER1/HER2 receptor heterodimerization and provides an additional mechanism of inhibiting tumors in which receptor coexpression and heterodimerization play a major role in driving tumor growth. The preclinical data support the advancement of BMS-599626 into clinical development for the treatment of cancer. DOCEND

Our objective in this study was to assess the effect of using two kinds of lead-free gasoline [including 92-lead-free gasoline (92-LFG) and 95-lead-free gasoline (95-LFG), rated according to their octane levels] to replace the use of premium leaded gasoline (PLG) on the emissions of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and their corresponding benzo[a]pyrene equivalent (BaP(eq)) amounts from the gasoline-powered engine. The results show that the three gasoline fuels originally contained similar total PAHs and total BaP(	eq	) contents; however, we found significant differences in the engine exhausts in both contents. The above results suggest that PAHs originally contained in the gasoline fuel did not affect the PAH emissions in the engine exhausts. The emission factors of both total PAHs and total BaP(eq) obtained from the three gasoline fuels shared the same trend: 95-LFG > PLG > 92-LFG. The above result suggests that when PLG was replaced by 95-LFG, the emissions would increase in both total PAHs and total BaP(eq), but when replaced by 92-LFG would lead to the decreased emissions of both contents.

A polyomavirus mutant (315YF) blocked in binding phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase) has previously been shown to be partially deficient in transformation and to induce fewer tumors and with a significant delay compared to wild-type virus. The role of polyomavirus middle T antigen-activated PI 3-kinase in apoptosis was investigated as a possible cause of this behavior. When grown in medium containing 1D-3-deoxy-3-fluoro-myo-inositol to block formation of 3'-phosphorylated phosphatidylinositols, F111 rat fibroblasts transformed by wild-type polyomavirus (PyF), but not normal F111 cells, showed a marked loss of viability with evidence of 	apoptosis	. Similarly, treatment with wortmannin, an inhibitor of PI 3-kinase, stimulated apoptosis in PyF cells but not in normal cells. Activation of Akt, a serine/threonine kinase whose activity has been correlated with regulation of apoptosis, was roughly twofold higher in F111 cells transformed by either wild-type virus or mutant 250YS blocked in binding Shc compared to cells transformed by mutant 315YF. In the same cells, levels of apoptosis were inversely correlated with Akt activity.

We found that an accumulation of trehalose could be observed at 5 degrees C, 0 degrees C and -5 degrees C and trehalase was suppressed in these temperature points during a gradually cooling environment. Then, in a gradually warming environment, trehalose levels increased slightly from -5 degrees C to 15 degrees C and then decreased at 25 degrees C; however, no significant negative association was observed between trehalase and trehalose. Additionally, we found that glycogen could be converted into 	trehalose	 to help the individual resist the low temperature. Analysis of the expression of soluble trehalase showed that HaTreh1-1, HaTreh1-2, HaTreh1-3 and HaTreh1-4 were involved in trehalose metabolism; but the gene HaTreh1-4 plays the most important role in the cooling process, and HaTreh1-2 and HaTreh1-4 play the most important role in the warming process.

This study provides a quantitative risk assessment based on analysis of 30 mouthwash samples. All investigated brands contained alcohol, most of them menthol (93%), eucalyptol (90%), benzoic acid (87%), methyl salicylate (67%), and 	thymol	 (30%). For low risk drinking scenarios with average levels, only ethanol will exceed acceptable daily intakes (ADI). In worst case scenarios for alcohol dependent consumers ingesting 100g ethanol per day in the form of mouthwash, methyl salicylate will also exceeded the ADI by a factor of 17. The margin of exposure (MOE) for methyl salicylate, benzoates and thymol was below 100 for average scenarios, and below 10 for worst case scenarios, but ethanol is still the most toxic ingredient with MOE below 1.

Eleven dogs with 4-week-old anterior wall myocardial infarctions, chronic indwelling intramyocardial electrodes and no inducible sustained ventricular tachycardia at baseline, were studied in the closed-chest state at baseline (control) and during intravenous infusion of dobutamine 10 micrograms/kg/min. Dobutamine caused reductions in the effective and absolute refractory periods in the infarct, peri-infarct and noninfarcted regions of the myocardium which were similar in magnitude at each region. With 	dobutamine	, only 1 dog had inducible sustained ventricular tachycardia (polymorphic). No spontaneous arrhythmias were seen. In summary, selective B1 adrenergic stimulation alone does not cause dispersion of myocardial refractoriness and does not cause significant proarrhythmia in the chronically infarcted canine heart. Additional metabolic, electrolyte or ischemic abnormalities may be required for B1 adrenergic stimulation to aggravate arrhythmias in this model. DOCEND

Registered diagnosis, spirometry results, comorbidity, and reported symptoms were compared. RESULTS: Among 376 patients, 62% were women. Based on Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Diseases criteria, a spirometry diagnosis of COPD could be made in 68.1% of the patients with a previous COPD diagnosis and in 17.1% of those diagnosed with 	asthma	 only (P < 0.001).

A restrictive spirometry pattern was found in 19.4% and more frequently in patients diagnosed with both asthma and COPD (23.9%) than in patients diagnosed with COPD only (6.8%, P = 0.003). CONCLUSION: The ability of GPs to differentiate between asthma and COPD seems to have considerably improved during the last decade, probably due to the dissemination of spirometry and guidelines for COPD diagnosis. A diagnosis of COPD that cannot be confirmed by spirometry represents a challenge in clinical practice, in particular when

FimH can recognize equally the (single) high-mannose glycan on uroplakin Ia, on the urinary defence protein uromodulin or Tamm-Horsfall glycoprotein and on the intestinal GP2 glycoprotein present in Peyer's patches. E. coli bacteria may attach to epithelial cells via hundreds of fimbriae in a multivalent fashion.

Changes in the dietary intake patterns of countries in the Asia Pacific region are considered in relation to trends of cardiovascular disease mortality. Cardiovascular disease now constitutes the major cause of mortality in many of the countries of the region. The mortality rate for coronary heart disease (CHD) has been on the decline since the mid-1960s in countries such as Australia, New Zealand and Japan, while a decline in other countries, including Singapore and Hong Kong, appears to be occurring about two decades later after a delayed increase. In contrast, countries like 	Malaysia	 and China have had and continue an upward trend for CHD mortality. Nonetheless, the mortality rates due to CHD in New Zealand, Australia, Singapore followed by Hong Kong rank among the highest in the region. In China, Taiwan and Japan, death due to cerebrovascular disease remains a major cause of death, although the latter two countries have undergone a significant decline in stroke death rates since 1970.

A similar effect of force-generating crossbridges has been suggested as an explanation for the coupling between load and activation which has been observed in skeletal and cardiac muscle. The goal of this study was to test the hypothesis that Ca2+-troponin affinity during crossbridge cycling is load-dependent. Ca2+-binding to detergent-extracted rabbit psoas fibres was measured during ATP-induced force generation and in the relaxed state. To compare Ca2+ binding in the latter two states it was necessary to establish conditions in which ATP-induced force could be regulated independently of free Ca2+ concentration. Such conditions were obtained by 	the use	 of either the ATPase inhibitor sodium vanadate or the substitution of MgITP for MgATP as an energy source. This study showed that in the presence of MgATP (or MgITP) the amount of Ca2+ bound to the myofilaments at a given free Ca2+ concentration was independent of the force generated. Thus force per se is not a determinant of Ca2+-troponin affinity. DOCEND

Previously, it was shown that plasma bilirubin levels can be decreased in rats with this defect by inducers of CYP1A enzymes. Here, liver microsomes from rats or mice treated with beta-naphthoflavone (BNF) or 3-methylcholanthrene (3 MC) had increased activity for bilirubin degradation. The activity was further stimulated by addition of the coplanar molecule 3,4,3',4'-tetrachlorobiphenyl (TCB). There was more stimulation of bilirubin degradation by TCB in microsomes from BNF-treated rats than in microsomes from BNF-treated mice. 	CYP1A1	 to CYP1A2 ratios were greater in rats treated with BNF. In Cyp1a2 (-/-) mutant mice, 3-MC treatment did not increase the rate of bilirubin degradation, but TCB increased this degradation severalfold. Between SWR and C57BL/6 inbred mouse strains that have a 2-fold difference in hepatic constitutive CYP1A2 levels, there was also a 2-fold difference in bilirubin degradation; TCB did not stimulate in either strain. We conclude that CYP1A2 is responsible for microsomal bilirubin degradation in the absence of TCB. TCB was required for bilirubin degradation by CYP1A1.

In this and two companion papers (Wenstrup et al. 1988a,b) that focused on binaurally inhibited neurons in this isofrequency region, our goal was to examine the neural mechanisms for binaural processing within a single frequency channel of the primary auditory system. 2. Binaurally excited neurons were defined as either excited by monaural input from both ears or, if excited by monaural stimulation of only one ear, facilitated by binaural stimulation. Some neurons also exhibited binaural inhibition. These neurons were divided into functional classes based on their responses to monaural and binaural stimulation presented under dichotic, closed-field conditions. 	The following notation	 was used: response to contralateral stimulation (E, excitatory; O, no effect), response to ipsilateral stimulation (E, excitatory; O, no effect)/response to binaural stimulation (F, facilitatory; I, inhibitory; O, no effect). Seven functional classes were observed: EE/O, EE/F, EE/I, EE/FI, EO/F, EO/FI, and OO/F. 3. Among EE neurons, thresholds for contralateral monaural stimulation were typically lower than for ipsilateral stimulation, and response magnitudes for contralateral stimulation were typically greater. Among EO/F and EO/FI neurons, only one eye, an OE/FI neuron, was excited by ipsilateral monaural stimulation. These results suggest that contralateral input provides the dominant excitatory influence. EE/FI and EO/FI neurons,

Recent studies have characterized chytridiomycosis as an emerging infectious disease, whose suspected rapid range expansion and widespread occurrence pose a significant risk for amphibian populations worldwide.

Neutrophils are typically the first responders in host defense against invading pathogens, which they destroy by both oxidative and nonoxidative mechanisms. However, despite a longstanding recognition of neutrophil presence at disease sites in tuberculosis, their role in defense against mycobacteria is unclear. Here we exploit the genetic tractability and optical transparency of zebrafish to monitor neutrophil behavior and its consequences during infection with Mycobacterium marinum, a natural fish pathogen. In contrast to macrophages, neutrophils do not interact with mycobacteria at initial infection sites. Neutrophils are subsequently recruited to the nascent granuloma in response to 	signals	 from dying infected macrophages within the granuloma, which they phagocytose. Some neutrophils then rapidly kill the internalized mycobacteria through NADPH oxidase-dependent mechanisms. Our results provide a mechanistic link to the observed patterns of neutrophils in human tuberculous granulomas and the susceptibility of humans with chronic granulomatous disease to mycobacterial infection.

Three additional rats with chronic bilateral renal denervation had cardiac arrest and were resuscitated with cardiac massage, i.v. lidocaine and intracardiac adrenaline administration. These animals showed a transient increase in urine flow rate, sodium and albumin excretion with maximum 30-60 min after resuscitation, while GFR and lithium clearance were normal. Since cardiac ischaemia and sympathetic stimulation are strong stimuli for the release of 	atrial natriuretic peptide	 (ANP), we examined if ANP (0.25, 0.50, and 1.00 microg kg(-1) min(-1), n = 8 per dose) affects urinary albumin excretion. ANP increased dose-dependently the urine/plasma concentration ratio of albumin relative to inulin, which suggests that ANP increases the glomerular permeability for albumin. We conclude that MI causes stimulation of renal tubular sodium and water reabsorption by a mechanism which is independent of intact renal innervation. MI does not produce any change in renal albumin excretion in rats, but transient albuminuria may be observed in rats following cardiac arrest and/or manoeuvres used in cardiac resuscitation. Since ANP produces albuminuria, we speculate

Background: Recent meta-analyses suggest that higher removal of beta-2 microglobulin (beta2M) with either high-flux (HFD) dialysis or hemodiafiltration (HDF) may be associated with decreased total and cardiovascular mortality in dialysis patients. However, there are limited data about the performance of high flux dialyzers and/or convective therapies in removing beta2M. Methods: This is a random effects meta-analysis and meta-regression of data extracted from randomized controlled trials and observational studies in hemodialysis, hemofiltration and HDF regarding the efficiency of high flux dialyzers to remove 	beta2M	. Studies were searched using ProQuest in SCOPUS, EMBASE and MEDLINE. Results: We included 69 studies from 1 January 2001 to 12 June 2017 on 1879 patients with 6771 available measurements. Average beta2M clearance was 48.75 mL/min [95% confidence interval (CI) 42.50-55.21] for conventional HF dialysis, and 87.06 mL/min (95% CI 75.08-99.03) for convective therapies (hemofiltration and HDF) with substantial heterogeneity among studies [P (Q) <= 0.001]. In multivariable meta-regression analyses, we found significantly higher beta2M clearance for polyarylethersulfone dialyzers when used for HFD and polysulfone membranes in convective therapies.

The results are simulated in terms of a layered Fresnel reflection model incorporating either a strained Fe overlayer or an Fe overlayer whose dielectric properties are approximated by a simple Lorentzian oscillator. Both approaches are found to produce simulated RA spectra that are in good agreement with experiment.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Chest wall recurrence occurs in 5-20% of 	breast cancer	 patients. Until recently, the only treatments available were surgical resection or radiotherapy. Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is a new modality that uses a photosensitizer and light to destroy tumor cells selectively. We report here our experience with PDT as a treatment for chest wall recurrence. METHODS: Seven patients with breast cancer who had chest wall recurrence despite previous therapy were treated with PDT. Four patients received one treatment, one received two treatments at the same site, one received two separate treatments at different sites, and one received three separate treatments at distinct sites. Response and adverse events were monitored. RESULTS: The

All limbs were anatomically dissected after the procedure and each was examined for injury to the sural nerve. The ability to visualize the sural nerve intraoperatively, improvement in ankle dorsiflexion, time requirement for the procedure, incision size, and appropriateness of placement to facilitate recession were recorded for each specimen. An average of 83% of the gastrocnemius aponeurosis was transected in all 15 cadavers. After modifications of the technique, the final eight cadavers were noted to have had the entire (100%) gastrocnemius aponeurosis transected. Sural nerve injury occurred in one specimen (	7%	) in which the aponeurosis and the sural nerve were not well visualized. The sural nerve was definitively visualized during the procedure in 5 of 15 specimens (33%). No Achilles tendon injury was noted in any specimen. There was a mean improvement in ankle dorsiflexion of 20 degrees (range, 10 degrees-30 degrees) during full knee extension. The average length of time to perform the procedure was 20 minutes (range, 10-35 minutes). The average medial and lateral incision lengths used in the two-portal technique were 18 mm (range, 14-22 mm) and 17 mm (range, 12-19 mm), respectively, and the average distance from

The G protein-coupled estrogen receptor (GPER) is known to facilitate rapid actions of 17beta-estradiol, though its role in modulation of ion channels is not widely explored. Several studies have shown both TREK1 and 17beta-estradiol to be neuromodulatory but the interaction between them is not known. In the present study, using single channel cell-attached patch clamp electrophysiology in HEK293 cells, we show that 17beta-estradiol increases the activity of hTREK1 channel by acting through hGPER and increasing the channel opening probability within minutes. The potentiation induced by 	17beta-estradiol	 is pertussis toxin - sensitive involving action of Gbetagamma subunits while the inhibitory effect of cAMP-PKA pathway on TREK1 is reduced. Protein phosphatases were also found to be important for the action of 17beta-estradiol, which in concert with reduced activity of PKA, may alter the phosphorylation state of the channel and thus increase channel activity. Mutational studies revealed the serines at positions 315 and 348 in the C-terminal domain of hTREK1 to be the target sites for dephosphorylation induced by 17beta-estradiol action through hGPER.

RhoA has been targeted pharmacologically to promote neurite outgrowth and functional recovery in the brain and spinal cord. However, the underlying mechanism of the inhibition of neurite outgrowth by Nogo-A has not yet been fully defined. Protein kinase B (PKB, also known as Akt) is a protein serine/threonine kinase that plays a key role in intracellular signaling and cellular homeostasis. This study reports the role of PKB signaling on Nogo-A-treated PC12 neuronal cells. An inhibitory fragment of Nogo-A (Nogo-66) activated 	RhoA	 and reduced the phosphorylation of PKB at Ser473 in a time-dependent manner. In contrast, pretreatment with Y27632, a specific inhibitor of Rho-A, resulted in an increase of the phosphorylation of PKB. Nogo-66 also inhibited the neurite outgrowth of PC12 cells, whereas pretreatment with LY294002, a specific inhibitor of PKB, ameliorated the neurite outgrowth.

The induction of a repetitive ventricular response (RVR) by programmed electrical stimulation (PES) in patients with malignant ventricular arrhythmias such as ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation is associated with poor prognosis. However, the incidence and clinical significance of RVR in patients with normal hearts and in those with coronary artery disease (CAD) who do not have a history of malignant ventricular arrhythmias are unknown. In this paper, we present our views on the clinical value of PES in those patients. The incidence of RVR in patients without evidence of 	heart disease	 remains controversial. The possible reasons for the disparities between studies are due to differences in the study populations and stimulation protocols used.

The same stimulation protocol was used in 136 patients with coronary artery disease.

When such plants are grown under low light intensities (3,000 lx), the newly formed leaves are green.

Pre-existing green leaves remain green in 20,000 lx, indicating that 	chlorophyll	 is not degraded.

We offer an overview of AR signaling pathways in different breast cancer subtypes, providing evidence that its oncogenic role is likely to be different in distinct biological and clinical scenarios. In particular, in ER-positive breast cancer, AR signaling often antagonizes the growth stimulatory effect of ER signaling; in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), AR seems to drive tumor progression (at least in luminal AR subtype of TNBC with a gene expression profile mimicking luminal subtypes despite being negative to ER and enriched in 	AR	 expression); in HER2-positive breast cancer, in the absence of ER expression, AR signaling has a proliferative role. These data represent the rationale for AR-targeting treatment as a potentially new target therapy in breast cancer subset using androgen agonists in some AR-positive/ER-positive tumors, AR antagonists in triple-negative/AR-positive tumors and in combination with anti-HER2 agents or with other signaling pathways inhibitors (including PI3K/MYC/ERK) in HER2-positive/AR-positive tumors.

The inhibition of the 45Ca uptake was also reversed by glucose, but differences were noted concerning the influence of preincubation time. The observations are explained by an association of 45Ca to cellular material, e.g. granules, secondary to the release process.

We investigated the presence of antibodies (Abs) against muscle-specific tyrosine kinase (MuSK) in Japanese myasthenia gravis (MG) patients. MuSK Abs were found in 23 (27%) of 85 generalized seronegative MG (SNMG) patients but not in any of the ocular MG patients. MuSK Ab-positive patients were characterized as having female dominance (M:F, 5:18), age range at onset 18 to 72 (median 45) years old, and prominent oculobulbar symptoms (100%) with neck (57%) or respiratory (35%) muscle weakness. Limb muscle weakness was comparatively less severe (52%), thymoma absent. Most patients had good responses to 	simple plasma exchange	 and steroid therapy. MuSK IgG from all 18 patients was exclusively the IgG 4 subclass and bound mainly with the MuSK Ig 1-2 domain. Serial studies of 12 individuals showed a close correlation between the variation in MuSK Ab titers and MG clinical severity (P = 0.01 by Kruskal-Wallis). MuSK Ab titers were sharply decreased in patients who had a good response to early steroid therapy or simple plasma exchange, but there was no change, or a rapid increase on exacerbation after thymectomy.

For the measurement of vasoactive substances, levels of prostacyclin (PGI2), determined by 6-keto-prostaglandin F1a, thromboxane A2 (TXA2), measured by thromboxane B2, endothelin-1 (ET-1), and nitric oxide (NO), measured by total nitrite, were assessed in endothelial cell supernatants. RESULTS: At lower concentrations (10-100 pg mL-1), TNF-alpha increases the intracellular content of LPO and GSH, stimulates the secretion of ET-1 and TXA2, but inhibits the secretion of PGI2 in endothelial cells compared with control cells. At concentration of 1000 pg mL-1, TNF-alpha increases the secretion of PGI2 and TXA2, but it decreases the ET-1 concentration. 	TNF-alpha	 has no effect on NO secretion. CONCLUSION: These findings demonstrate that at concentrations corresponding to values in plasma from preeclamptic women, TNF-alpha induces oxidative stress and results in altered secretion of vasoactive substances in favour of vasoconstrictors in human endothelial cells. We conclude that TNF-alpha may participate in the pathway leading to endothelial cell dysfunction seen in preeclampsia. DOCEND

BACKGROUND/AIMS: LRRK2 (leucine-rich repeat protein kinase 2) is one of the most commonly accepted genes associated with 	Parkinson's disease	 (PD). The overexpression of disease-associated mutations in LRRK2 is toxic to the cells, while reduction or elimination of LRRK2 expression promotes cell health and growth. Thus, the identification of an LRRK2 inhibitor with good physiochemical and pharmacokinetic properties is of great interest for the treatment of PD. METHODS: In this study, we have investigated LRRK2 compounds, LRRK2-IN-1 and Compound 1, in vitro and in vivo to determine how suitable they are as a selective LRRK2 tool compound. RESULTS: We report that Compound 1, patented by GSK, is a potent and selective LRRK2 inhibitor with good blood-brain barrier permeability as reflected

This study was performed to determine if 	this approach	 preserves renal mass and function when compared with initial surgical resection followed by chemotherapy. Over a 20-year period (1970 to 1990), 15 patients with synchronous bilateral Wilms' tumor were treated at the Childrens Hospital of Los Angeles. Eight patients in the surgical group underwent initial unilateral nephrectomy with contralateral biopsy, wedge resection, or partial nephrectomy and subsequent chemotherapy.

We measured the urinary excretion of 5-hydroxyindole-acetic-acid (5-HIAA), the main metabolite of serotonin, in 24 patients with 42 courses of cisplatin containing chemotherapies. Patterns of 5-HIAA excretion were compared between patients with emesis and patients who are completely protected from vomiting. Three groups of patients without chemotherapy served as control. The first group did not receive any medication. The second and third group were given a single dose of ondansetron or metoclopramide. The median 	5-HIAA	/creatinine ratios in the control group ranged from 3.8 to 6.9 with a median of 6.2 (mu g 5-HIAA/mg creatinine). Neither ondansetron nor metoclopramide given without chemotherapy induced significant changes in 5-HIAA excretion patterns. 23 courses (55%) were associated with acute cisplatin-induced emesis. The median interval from the start of the cisplatin infusion to the peak 5-HIAA excretion was shorter in patients with acute emesis, but the cumulative amount of urinary 5-HIAA did not differ between patients with or without emesis. Patients who are efficiently protected from vomiting as well as patients who experience emesis show a comparable increase in

Proper evaluation of the neurogenic bladder remains the cornerstone for accurate management of the neurologically impaired patient. Due to the inherent progressive nature of many neurologic disorders causing bladder dysfunction and lack of targeted medical therapy, 	much work	 has been done and needs to be done to advance the management of this often-difficult patient population. This article reviews the latest advances in managing the neurogenic bladder. For ease of review, the neurogenic bladder can be divided into 2 basic categories: first, bladders that fail to empty successfully and, second, those that fail to store urine adequately. Therapy should be based on these categories because poor therapeutic results are seen when a standard treatment is prescribed for the wrong bladder condition.

Reception was very warm for the convinced, cold or slightly hostile for the doubters, and extremely hostile or derisive for the orthodox. We identified seven main rhetorical strategies of persuasion used by the denialists on the "undecided". CONCLUSIONS: Contrary to the widespread public health depiction of AIDS denialists as totally irrational, our study suggests that some of those who become AIDS denialists have sufficiently reasonable grounds to suspect that "something is wrong" with scientific theory, because their personal experience contradicts the unitary picture of AIDS disease progression. Odd and inexplicable practices of some 	AIDS	 centers only fuel these people's suspicions. We can conclude that public health practitioners' practices may play a role in generating AIDS-denialist sentiments. In interactions with the newcomers, the experienced community members highlighted the importance of personal autonomy and freedom of choice in decision making consistent with the consumerist ideology of health care. The study findings suggest that health care workers should change a one-size-fits-all mode of counseling for a more complex and patient-tailored approach, allowing for diversity of disease progression scenarios and scientific uncertainty.

The Marfan syndrome group also had more intraoperative cerebrospinal fluid leaks (3 vs. 0, P = 0.01), significantly more instrumentation complications (3 vs. 1, P = 0.007), more reoperations for indications [such as fixation failure, distal degeneration, and spine fracture (9 vs. 0, 	P = 0.01	)], and lower SRS-22 total (3.9 vs. 4.5, P = 0.01) and partial (P < 0.015) subscores. There were no significant differences between the groups in progression of unfused proximal thoracic curves, blood loss, neurological deficit, hospital stay, percent correction, or infection rate. CONCLUSION: Patients with Marfan syndrome differ in several ways from those with AIS: they require more levels of surgical correction, more distal fusion, greater correction of sagittal balance, and more reoperations, and they have more intraoperative cerebrospinal fluid leaks and instrumentation-related complications. Knowledge of these differences is important for planning surgery. DOCEND

The tridentate amino acids such as cysteine, 	glutamic acid	, and histidine were predominantly found cross-linked to DNA. The mechanism by which Cr can cross-link these amino acids to DNA has been modeled by reacting DNA and trivalent and hexavalent chromium with cysteine and histidine. The formation of a Cr(III)-amino acid binary complex was required before Cr(III) reacted with DNA to yield a ternary complex. Cr(III)-pretreated DNA did not bind cysteine or histidine even after prolonged incubations. Reduction of Cr(VI) in the presence of DNA gave rise to an extensive cross-linking of cysteine and histidine. Addition of DNA to Cr(VI) mixtures at the start of reduction or after the reduction

Moreover, overexpression of miR-7 significantly inhibited the proliferation and invasion of HCC cells. Over 100 target genes of miR-7 were predicted by Targetscan, and KLF-4 was indicated as the most promising candidate. Luciferase report assay showed that KLF-4 could be silenced by 	miR-7	, so as to restore the impairment of cell proliferation and invasion in HCC cells.

Our study confirms that the rs12979860-T/T genotype has a strong correlation with ss469415590-DeltaG/DeltaG single nucleotide polymorphism that produces IFN-lambda4 protein. We found that IFN-alpha and IFN-lambda1 antiviral activity against HCV was impaired in IL28B T/T infected hepatocytes compared with C/C genotype. Western blot analysis showed that 	IL28B	 TT genotype hepatocytes expressed higher levels of IFN-lambda proteins (IL28B, IL-29), preactivated IFN-stimulated gene (ISG) expression, and impaired Stat phosphorylation when stimulated with either IFN-alpha or IFN-lambda1.

Likewise, overexpression of IFN-lambda (1 to 4) in C/C cells induced basal ISG expression and prevented IFN-alpha antiviral activity.

Here we demonstrate that although the two mechanisms are similar, the events that lead to activation of caspase 3 can be distinguished in vivo on the basis of their sensitivities to both pharmacological and virus-encoded caspase inhibitors. In cytotoxic T lymphocytes-mediated death the initial cleavage event on caspase 3 is insensitive to benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp fluoromethyl ketone (zVAD-fmk) inhibition in both mouse and human systems. During Fas-mediated death, however, activation of 	caspase 3	 is completely inhibited to zVAD-fmk. In addition, the viral serpin SPI-2, a homologue of cytokine response modifier A (crmA), is an effective inhibitor of the Fas but not the granzyme pathway. Our results demonstrate that whereas Fas-mediated activation of caspase 3 requires an upstream caspase activity that is zVAD-fmk-sensitive, the initial cleavage of caspase 3 during granule-mediated cell death is insensitive to zVAD-fmk, suggesting that caspase 3 is cleaved directly by granzyme B in vivo.

RESULTS: At the highly stringent threshold of False Discovery Rate (FDR) = 0, 31 single genes were differentially expressed in AA. PSPH exhibited the greatest fold-change (AA > CA), but this was entirely accounted for by a homolog (PSPHL) hidden within the PSPH probe set. Among other significantly different genes were: for AA > CA, 	SOS1	, AMFR, FGFR3; and for AA < CA, ARVCF, BIN3, EIF4B.

Using the biological systems approach, we identified shear response biology as being significantly different for AA versus CA, showing an apparent tonic increase of expression (AA > CA) for 46/157 genes within that system. CONCLUSIONS: Many of the genes implicated here have substantial roles in endothelial biology. Shear stress response, a critical regulator of endothelial function and vascular homeostasis, may be different between AA and CA. These results potentially have direct implications for the

In vitro, ART could induce cytotoxicity and apoptosis in bladder cancer cells, but presented a much lighter toxicity effect against normal human urothelial cells. ART significantly increased miR-16 expression and decreased the expression of COX-2 and the production of PGE2. More importantly, down-regulation of miR-16 expression could reverse the effect of ART on apoptosis and 	COX-2	 expression in bladder cells. Moreover, exogenous PGE2 could inhibit apoptosis of bladder cancer cells treated with ART. In conclusion, ART can elicit an anti-tumor effect against bladder cancer by up-regulation of miR-16 expression, which resulted in the decrease of COX-2 expression and PGE2 production. Hence, ART might be an effective drug for the treatment of bladder cancer. DOCEND

Recent findings suggest that myocardial mitochondrial dysfunction may play an important role in the pathogenesis of cardiac contractile dysfunction in obesity, insulin resistance and Type 2 diabetes. This review will discuss potential molecular mechanisms for these mitochondrial abnormalities. DOCEND
3024026	T38	out	DOCSTART Adenosine analogs mediating depressant effects on synaptic transmission in rat hippocampus: structure-activity relationships for the N6 subregion. Previous studies have shown that analogs of adenosine with substituents upon the N6-nitrogen (e.g., N6-[1-phenyl-2(R)-propyl]adenosine; R-PIA) are often much more potent than the parent compound in activating adenosine receptors, particularly those of the A1 subtype. The present investigation characterized 	the potencies	 of a number of N6-substituted adenosine analogs in depressing excitatory synaptic transmission in slices of rat hippocampus, an electrophysiological response mediated by receptors of the A1 subtype. These potencies correlated well with previously reported affinities of these analogs for A1 receptor sites in brain, but not with coronary vasodilation in the dog heart, an A2 receptor mediated response. Analogs with alkyl or aryl substituents at the N6 position were generally more potent than adenosine, although analogs with a tertiary carbon attached directly to the N6-nitrogen were usually only weakly active. Although it has been suggested that there may be a

To elucidate the regulation of CRLs by Cand1, we analyzed a Cand1 mutant in Drosophila. Loss of Cand1 causes accumulation of neddylated Cullin3 (Cul3) and stabilizes the Cul3 adaptor protein HIB. In addition, the Cand1 mutation stimulates protein degradation of Cubitus interruptus (Ci), suggesting that Cul3-RING ligase activity is enhanced by the loss of Cand1. However, the loss of Cand1 fails to repress the accumulation of Ci in Nedd8(AN015) or CSN5(null) mutant clones. Although Cand1 is able to bind both 	Cul1	 and Cul3, mutation of Cand1 suppresses only the accumulation of Cul3 induced by the dAPP-BP1 mutation defective in the neddylation pathway, and this effect is attenuated by inhibition of proteasome function. Furthermore, overexpression of Cand1 stabilizes the Cul3 protein when the neddylation pathway is partially suppressed. These data indicate that Cand1 stabilizes unneddylated Cul3 by preventing proteasomal degradation. Here, we propose that binding of Cand1 to unneddylated Cul3 causes a shift in the equilibrium away from the neddylation of Cul3 that is required for the degradation of substrate by CRLs, and protects unneddylated Cul3 from proteasomal degradation. Cand1 regulates Cul3-mediated

The clinical evaluation of symptomatic women is challenging due to their varying clinical presentation, clinical risk factor burden, high degree of comorbidity, and increased risk of major ischemic heart disease events. Evidence is substantial that both SPECT and PET MPI effectively risk stratify women with SIHD. The addition of coronary flow reserve (CFR) with PET improves risk detection, including for women with nonobstructive 	coronary artery disease	 and coronary microvascular dysfunction. With the advent of PET with computed tomography (CT), multiparametric imaging approaches may enable integration of MPI and CFR with CT visualization of anatomical atherosclerotic plaque to uniquely identify at-risk women.

Active (ouabain-sensitive) and passive (ouabain-insensitive) fluxes of 43K were measured in isolated bovine zona fasciculata/reticularis cells. ACTH inhibited passive influx in a dose-dependent manner and, at a concentration that maximally stimulated steroidogenesis (10(-8) M), also inhibited passive efflux. ACTH did not affect active potassium transport. Angiotensin II (10(-6) M) and cAMP (10(-2) M) inhibited passive influx to the same extent as did 10(-8) M ACTH. Angiotensin II (10(-6) M) also reduced active potassium uptake, although this did not appear to be related to changes in cortisol biosynthesis. Increases in cortisol synthesis by ouabain-treated cells in 	response	 to angiotensin II and ACTH were proportional to decreases in potassium influx. The addition of cortisol (1 microgram/ml) to cells slightly reduced passive potassium uptake, but not to the same extent as did 10(-8) M ACTH. Frusemide, an inhibitor of passive sodium/potassium cotransport, did not wholly abolish the effects of ACTH on potassium influx. These changes in flux are probably related to electrophysiological changes in membrane potential. Their significance in the regulation of ACTH actions has yet to be determined. DOCEND

Chlorpromazine was used as a model drug irritant. When chlorpromazine and saline were applied over a range of current densities from 0 to 200 microA/cm2, visual scores of erythema and edema yielded a correlation with measured skin efflux of PGE2 (r = 0.86). 	Delivery	 of chlorpromazine resulted in greater efflux of PGE2 than delivery of non-irritant saline controls under the same delivery conditions. Five drug compounds, chloroquine, promazine, chlorpromazine, tetracaine, metoclopramide, and saline were applied to hairless guinea pig skin. The 6 agents were similarly rank ordered by visual erythema/edema scores and by PGE2 efflux, indicating that the quantity of PGE2 effluxed reflects the intensity of skin irritation. In contrast, vasoconstriction or vasodilation produced by the local delivery of vasoactive agents did not correlate with PGE2 skin efflux, indicating that this measurement is specific for an inflammatory response.

OBJECTIVES: To examine the extent to which the attributes of a treatment affect dermatologists' choice of drug therapy and explore the magnitude and nature of the trade-offs between the risks and benefits of treatment. METHODS: A postal questionnaire was sent to members of the British Association of Dermatologists (BAD). The questionnaire used a discrete choice experiment (DCE) to elicit dermatologists' preferences for the treatment of psoriasis. In all, 227 dermatologists completed the questionnaire. The results indicated that time to moderate improvement, time to relapse, 	risk	 of hypertension, liver damage, skin cancer and skin irritation were all important factors affecting dermatologists' choice of treatment. Comparing the coefficients for the different side-effects indicated that the dermatologists considered the risk of liver damage to be the most important side-effect, followed by the risk of skin cancer. The time to achieve a moderate (50%) improvement in psoriasis was prioritized over the time to relapse. CONCLUSIONS: This study has provided novel insight into the trade-offs that dermatologists face when selecting treatment for psoriasis patients.

Yeast cells producing mammalian-type N-linked oligosaccharide show severe growth defects and the decreased protein productivity because of the disruption of yeast-specific glycosyltransferases. This decreased protein productivity in engineered yeast strains is an obstacle to the development of efficient glycoprotein production in yeast. For economic and effective synthesis of such therapeutic glycoproteins in yeast, the development of appropriate strains is highly desirable. We applied a novel mutagenesis technique that utilized the proofreading-deficient DNA polymerase delta variant encoded by the pol3-01 gene of Saccharomyces cerevisiae or the cdc6-1 gene of Schizosaccharomyces pombe to the engineered S. cerevisiae TIY20 strain and 	S. pombe	 KT97 strain, respectively. TIY20, which is deficient in the outer chain of mannan due to the disruption of three genes (och1Delta, mnn1 Delta, mnn4 Delta), and KT97, which is an och1 disruptant, are impractical as hosts for the production of therapeutic glycoproteins since they show a temperature-sensitive (ts) phenotype, a growth defect phenotype, and decreased protein productivity. We successfully isolated YAB mutants that alleviated the growth defect of the TIY20 strain. Surprisingly, these mutants generally secreted foreign proteins better than the wild-type strain. Furthermore, we successfully isolated YPAB mutants that alleviated the growth defect of the KT97 strain, too. The

Its negative impact on respiratory function has previously been described using either forced expiration or forced oscillations techniques. However, sedation or drug-induced bronchoconstriction were usually required.

Measurements of unidirectional calcium fluxes in stripped intestinal epithelium of the tilapia, Oreochromis mossambicus, in the presence of ouabain or in the absence of sodium indicated that calcium absorption via the fish intestine is sodium dependent. Active Ca2+ transport mechanisms in the enterocyte plasma membrane were analyzed. The maximum capacity of the 	ATP	-dependent Ca2+ pump (Vm: 0.63 nmol.min-1.mg-1, Km:27 nM Ca2+) is calculated to be 2.17 nmol.min-1.mg-1, correcting for 29% inside-out oriented vesicles in the membrane preparation. The maximum capacity of the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger with high affinity for Ca2+ (Vm:7.2 nmol.min-1.mg-1, Km:181 nM Ca2+) is calculated to be 13.6 nmol.min-1.mg-1, correcting for 53% resealed vesicles and assuming symmetrical behavior of the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger. The high affinity for Ca2+ and the sixfold higher capacity of the exchanger compared to the ATPase suggest strongly that the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger will contribute substantially to Ca2+ extrusion in the fish enterocyte.

Sequential treatment with IFN-gamma followed by TNF, but not in the opposite order, could reproduce the early effects of differentiation in neuroblastoma cells, supporting a role for TNF receptor up-regulation as a basis for the cooperation between the two cytokines.

In Goldrush, only inoculation with G. etunicatum led to a significant reduction in disease severity, ranging between 60.2% and 71.2%, on both shoot and crown. This decrease was not observed in LP89221. Compared with the control plantlets, inoculation of Goldrush with G. etunicatum or G. intraradices reduced significantly the mortality rate by 77% and 26%, respectively, whereas vesicular-arbuscular mycorrhizal (VAM) fungi did not significantly influence the mortality rate in LP89221. In Goldrush, 	inoculation	 with G. etunicatum significantly increased shoot fresh weight, root dry weight and the number of tubers produced per plant, whereas G. intraradices only significantly increased the number of tubers. Tuber and root fresh weights of both potato cultivars were significantly reduced by R. solani infection. However, R. solani-infected plantlets of both Goldrush and LP89221, inoculated with G. etunicatum, produced significantly greater tuber fresh weight than non-VAM plantlets. In R. solani-infected plantlets of Goldrush but not LP89221, G. etunicatum and G. intraradices increased root fresh weight by approximately 140.3% and 76.5%, respectively, compared with non-VAM plants.

To investigate the possible correlation between vitiligo and peripheral monoaminergic system activity, we used high-pressure liquid chromatography and electrochemical detector methods to evaluate the basal urine excretion values of catecholamines [norepinephrine (NE), epinephrine and dopamine (DA)], their relative metabolites [3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylglycol (MHPG), normetanephrine (NMN), metanephrine (MN), vanilmandelic acid (VMA) and homovanillic acid], as well as 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA), in 35 healthy subjects and in 70 patients, suffering from non-segmental vitiligo at different stages of the disease. Levels of NE, DA, 	NMN	, MN, MHPG, VMA and 5-HIAA were found to be significantly higher in patients than in controls. The patients with progressive vitiligo (n = 56) presented increased urinary excretion values for all parameters (in particular, NE levels) than other patients. Interestingly, in patients at its more recent vitiligo onset (<1 yr), NE values were different to those of subjects affected from 1 to 5 yr and from 6 to 10 yr. This result was confirmed by the significant negative relationship detected between NE excretion values and disease duration. In both vitiligo and control groups, significant correlations were found between monoamines as well

Based on our results, we can also identify functionally interacting target genes, for instance, a group of co-regulated proteins related to cell wall synthesis. Furthermore, we report novel conserved binding sites of a glycoprotein-encoding gene, CIS3, regulated by Swi6-Swi4 and Ndd1-Fkh2-Mcm1 complexes. CONCLUSION: We provide a simple method to prioritize individual TF-gene interactions from large-scale transcriptional modules. In comparison with other published works, we predict a complementary set of regulatory interactions which yields a similar or higher prediction accuracy at the expense of sensitivity. Therefore, our method can serve as an alternative approach to 	prioritization	 for further experimental studies. DOCEND
11862261	T8	che	DOCSTART Modulation of Substance P Release in Primary Sensory Neurons by Misoprostol and Prostaglandins. Pain is one of the cardinal signs of inflammation. A number of inflammatory mediators have been shown in animal models to induce or augment pain. Of particular interest are the prostaglandins (PGs), which are arachidonic acid metabolites and can be pharmacologically regulated by cyclooxygenase inhibitors, the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Indeed, NSAIDs are potent modulators of pain sensitivity. They are thought to mediate their hypoalgesic action through inhibition of 	prostaglandin	 production. However, indiscriminate inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis also creates a significant number of clinical side effects, among them gastrointestinal toxicity. With the introduction of misoprostol, a PGE(1) analog, a large number of investigative possibilities are opened. We have proposed to study the effect of misoprostol in an in vitro pain model. Our model, created by culturing primary sensory neurons isolated from dorsal root ganglions, was then differentiated by nerve growth factor and subjected to electrical stimulation. Substance P release following electrical stimulation was quantitated by radioimmunoassay. We found that misoprostol augmented substance P release in a dose-related manner. With 100

Flux in the opposite direction was not inhibited by 9 mM ATP. Thus ATP causes true, current rectification in SCl channels. Inhibition by cytoplasmic ATP was also voltage dependent, having a K(I) of 0.4-1 mM at -40 mV (Hill coefficient approximately 2), which increased at more negative potentials. Luminal ATP inhibited with a K(I) of approximately 2 mM at +40 mV, and showed no block at negative voltages. Hidden Markov model analysis revealed that ATP inhibition 1) reduced 	mean open times	 without altering the maximum channel amplitude, 2) was mediated by a novel, single, voltage-independent closed state (approximately 1 ms), and 3) was much less potent on lower conductance substates than the higher conductance states. Therefore, the SCl channel is unlikely to pass Cl- from cytoplasm to SR lumen in vivo, and balance electrogenic Ca2+ uptake as previously suggested. Possible roles for the SCl channel in the transport of other anions are discussed. DOCEND

METHODS: Participants ( n=2832) were from the Toronto Nutrigenomics and Health Study and the Toronto Healthy Diet Study. Individuals were screened for CD-specific anti-tissue transglutaminase autoantibodies. Lipid profiles as well as concentrations of six carotenoids (alpha-carotene, beta-carotene, 	beta-cryptoxanthin	, lutein, lycopene, and zeaxanthin), three tocopherols (alpha-tocopherol, delta-tocopherol, and gamma-tocopherol), retinol, ascorbic acid, and 25-hydroxyvitamin D were cross-sectionally compared between those with positive and negative CD serology using general linear mixed models. RESULTS: Individuals with positive CD serology ( n=23) had significantly lower levels of HDL-cholesterol ( p=0.008) and apolipoprotein-AI ( p=0.02), a higher ratio of total cholesterol to HDL-cholesterol ( p=0.006), and a higher apolipoprotein-B/AI ratio ( p=0.03) than those with negative CD serology.

A standardized American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) guide for the conduct of FETAX has been published, along with a companion atlas that helps in embryo staging and in identifying malformations. As part of the ASTM process, an interlaboratory validation study was undertaken to evaluate the repeatability and reliability of FETAX and to evaluate the potential teratogenic hazard of 12 compounds. Three different laboratories participated in the study. All three participating laboratories had extensive experience with the assay. FETAX intralaboratory and interlaboratory variability, as judged by coefficients of variation, were very low. Potential teratogenic hazard was evaluated using 	two major criteria	 from FETAX experiments employing metabolic activation systems (MAS). These were the teratogenic index TI (TI = 96-h lc(50)/96-h ec(50) (malformation)) and the minimum concentration that inhibits growth (MCIG). A compound was considered teratogenic by this criterion when the MCIG was significantly different from controls at concentrations below the 30% level of the MAS 96-h lc(50). Based on the results of this and other studies, a decision table was constructed in order to evaluate additional studies. Severity of malformations caused, especially near the MAS 96-h ec(50) (malformation), were also evaluated. Four compounds were non-teratogenic but two compounds were clearly teratogenic.

Patients with visceral metastases responded in 36% and patients with > or = 3 organs involved in 33%.

In conclusion, docetaxel represents one of the most active agents for second-line treatment of metastatic breast cancer, especially for anthracycline-resistant patients. Due to comparable effectiveness of the 5-day regimen which is widely used by others and the 3-day premedication tested in this trial the latter proved to be more favourable and was therefore recommended for future therapies.

The release (=the measured loss) of amino acids was studied in Commelina benghalensis leaf disks. The release is assumed to be the result of influx and efflux, therefore, both movements were investigated.The uptake of (14)C-labeled valine exhibited a biphasic isotherm. The uptake was pH-dependent, especially at low substrate concentrations (pH optimum 4.8). Signals for amino acid/proton co-transport were observed: stimulation of the uptake by 	fusicoccin	 (FC), inhibition by diethylstilbestrol (DES) or by high K(+) concentrations. In the light, the ATP level of the disks was maintained during the uptake period (2 h), in darkness the ATP content decreased from 87 to 24 nmol g(-1) fr. wt. However, light-promoted uptake, which is explained in the proton pump concept by an intensified proton extrusion as the result of high ATP production, was lacking.The release of amino acids was increased by washing with p-chloromercuriphenyl sulphonic acid (PCMBS), nystatin, 3(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea (DCMU), or KCN.

The association of low-dose thalidomide with prednisone has better tolerability, and it is also effective.

OBJECTIVE: To test the hypothesis that impaired Ca2+ recycling by the sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca-ATPase contributes to augmented force development in arteries from stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRSP). METHODS: Force development to caffeine (0.3-30 mmol/l) in the absence of extracellular Ca2+ was compared in aortic strips from SHRSP and Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats. In another protocol the strips were rinsed at the peak of contraction to caffeine (20 mmol/l) and subsequently restimulated with the alkaloid. The second response, dependent on recycled Ca2+, was used as a measure of sarcoplasmic reticulum function. 	A third protocol	 evaluated caffeine-induced contractions after Ca2+ depletion and reloading. In these latter experiments the effects of thapsigargin, an inhibitor of the sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca-ATPase, and ryanodine, an activator of sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ release channels, were used to evaluate Ca2+ buffering. Finally, unidirectional 45Ca2+ influx was measured. RESULTS: Contractions to caffeine (0.3-30 mmol/l) were larger in SHRSP aortic strips than in WKY rat strips. After a rinse at the peak of the initial response to caffeine, SHRSP segments contracted more when challenged a second time.

Eighty-six men were randomized to treatment with isoflavones (n=42) or placebo (n=44) for up to six weeks prior to scheduled prostatectomy. We performed microarray analysis using a targeted cell cycle regulation and apoptosis gene chip (GEArrayTM). Changes in serum total testosterone, free testosterone, total estrogen, estradiol, PSA, and total 	cholesterol	 were analyzed at baseline, mid-point, and at the time of radical prostatectomy. In this preliminary analysis, 12 genes involved in cell cycle control and 9 genes involved in apoptosis were down-regulated in the treatment tumor tissues versus the placebo control. Changes in serum total testosterone, free testosterone, total estrogen, estradiol, PSA, and total cholesterol in the isoflavone-treated group compared to men receiving placebo were not statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: These data suggest that short-term intake of soy isoflavones did not affect serum hormone levels, total cholesterol, or PSA.

Apart from having implications for mutagenesis and DNA photoprotection mechanisms, the photochemistry of cytidines is a central element in UV-assisted syntheses of pyrimidine nucleotides under prebiotically plausible conditions. In this contribution, we present UV-irradiation experiments of beta-2'-deoxycytidine in aqueous solution involving H-D exchange followed by NMR spectroscopic analysis of the photoproducts. We further elucidate the outcome of these experiments by means of high-level quantum chemical calculations. In particular, we show that prolonged UV-irradiation of cytidine may lead to H-C1' hydrogen atom abstraction by the carbonyl oxygen atom of 	cytosine	. This process may enable photoanomerisation and nucleobase loss, two previously unexplained photoreactions observed in pyrimidine nucleotides. DOCEND

Deregulated apoptosis of germ cells may contribute to male infertility as well as malignant transformation. Survivin, an inhibitor of apoptosis (IAP), is overexpressed in all the most common human malignancies, but barely detectable in normal tissues. We used real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to quantify survivin mRNA expression in normal testes (n = 22), testes with 	defective spermatogenesis	 (n = 26) and testicular germ cell tumours (TGCTs; n = 16). Survivin was expressed at high levels in normal testes. Testicular survivin levels in infertile patients were related inversely to the severity of spermatogenic failure (p < 0.001), with a lack of expression in most specimens with pre-meiotic spermatogenic arrest and in all those with germ cell aplasia. Lower levels of expression were observed in TGCTs than in normal testes. While survivin expression was detected in most TGCTs with undifferentiated components (12 of 13), it was absent in all mature teratomas (n = 3). These data show that survivin is expressed in normal

We also showed that the expression level of Pim-1L and BCRP was up-regulated in mitoxantrone and docetaxel-resistant prostate cancer cell lines. Pim-1L was co-localized with BCRP on the plasma membrane and induced phosphorylation of BCRP at threonine 362. Knocking-down Pim-1L expression in the drug-resistant prostate cancer cells abolished multimer formation of endogenous BCRP and resensitized the resistant cells to chemotherapeutic drugs suggesting that BCRP phosphorylation induced by Pim-1L was essential for its functionality. This is further corroborated by our finding that the plasma membrane localization and drug-resistant activity of 	BCRP	 were compromised by T362A mutation. Our data suggest that Pim-1L may protect prostate cancer cells from apoptosis, at least in part, through regulation of transmembrane drug efflux pump. These findings may provide a potential therapeutic approach by disrupting Pim-1 signaling to reverse BCRP-mediated multidrug resistance. DOCEND

Recently, terminally differentiated human neurons have received much attention as a means to study the interaction between VZV and human neurons; however, the short life-span of these cells in culture has limited their application. Herein, we describe the construction of a model of normal human neural progenitor cells (NHNP) in tissue-like assemblies (TLAs), which can be successfully maintained for at least 180 days in three-dimensional (3D) culture, and exhibit an expression profile similar to that of human trigeminal ganglia. Infection of NHNP TLAs with cell-free 	VZV	 resulted in a persistent infection that was maintained for three months, during which the virus genome remained stable. Immediate-early, early and late VZV genes were transcribed, and low-levels of infectious VZV were recurrently detected in the culture supernatant. Our data suggest that NHNP TLAs are an effective system to investigate long-term interactions of VZV with complex assemblies of human neuronal cells. DOCEND

Circumstantial evidence that the O13 antigen is a microcapsular, acidic polymer, rather than an integral part of the lipopolysaccharide, has been obtained. Degradative and spectroscopic studies established that the polymer is based on the repeating unit shown, in which the glucuronic acid residue of the linear pentasaccharide carries the lateral 2-acetamido-2-deoxy-beta-D-glucopyranosyl substituent in only about half of the units.

To further understand the biochemical properties of M. tuberculosis GpgS, we determined the three-dimensional structure of the apo enzyme, as well as of its ternary complex with UDP and 3-phosphoglycerate, by X-ray crystallography, to a resolution of 2.5 and 2.7 A, respectively. GpgS, the first enzyme from the newly established GT-81 family to be structurally characterized, displays a dimeric architecture with an overall fold similar to that of other GT-A-type glycosyltransferases. 	These three-dimensional structures	 provide a molecular explanation for the enzyme's preference for UDP-containing donor substrates, as well as for its glucose versus mannose discrimination, and uncover the structural determinants for acceptor substrate selectivity. Glycosyltransferases constitute a growing family of enzymes for which structural and mechanistic data urges. The three-dimensional structures of M. tuberculosis GpgS now determined provide such data for a novel enzyme family, clearly establishing the molecular determinants for substrate recognition and catalysis, while providing an experimental scaffold for the structure-based rational design of specific inhibitors, which lay the foundation for the development of novel anti-tuberculosis therapies.

Specificity analysis, using allogeneic antigen presenting cells, revealed that the clones were either restricted to DR3- or DR4-like molecules, which is consistent with the fact that the donor was DR3, DR4 positive. However, the studies also revealed that 	the fine specificity	 of the DR3 and DR4 restriction could not be completely assessed by serological and genomic typing of panel cells. This indicates that cellularly defined HLA restriction elements recognized by T cells cannot be defined properly with available class II typing methods, and the results of these experiments documented the additional polymorphism of class II restriction elements.

Consequently, the placenta is likely to have a key role in mediating the programming effects of suboptimal conditions during development.

Cholestyramine and vancomycin were also tested for therapeutic efficacy in the hamster model of clindamycin-induced cecitis. Both compounds delayed death and reduced levels of cytotoxin in stool; these effects were greatest for vancomycin. Use of the two compounds in combination reduced concentrations of biologically active vancomycin in stool, but the levels still exceeded the minimum inhibitory concentration for C. difficile. These data suggest that the therapeutic benefit of cholestyramine in some patients with antibiotic-associated pseudomembranous colitis is due to its binding of the C. difficile cytotoxin.

In addition to its effect on high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesteryl ester (CE) uptake, scavenger receptor BI (SR-BI) was recently reported to stimulate free cholesterol (FC) flux from Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells stably expressing mouse SR-BI, a novel function of SR-BI that may play a role in cholesterol removal from the vessel wall where the receptor can be found. It is possible that 	SR-BI	 stimulates flux simply by tethering acceptor HDL particles in close apposition to the cell surface thereby facilitating the movement of cholesterol between the plasma membrane and HDL. To test this, we used transiently transfected cells and compared the closely related class B scavenger receptors mouse SR-BI and rat CD36 for their ability to stimulate cholesterol efflux as both receptors bind HDL with high affinity. The results showed that, although acceptor binding to SR-BI may contribute to efflux to a modest extent, the major stimulation of FC efflux occurs independently of acceptor binding to cell surface receptors.

Both Kd and Koc were well described by regression models with SOC and soil pH as variables, regardless of scale. Surprisingly, variations in 2,4-D mineralization were much smaller than variations in sorption. Variability in total 	2,4-D	 mineralization was particularly low, with a coefficient of variation of only 7% at the provincial scale. Average 2,4-D half-lives in ecoregions ranged from 1.7 to 3.5 d, much lower than the field dissipation half-life of 10 d reported for 2,4-D in general pesticide property databases. Regression models describing degradation parameters were generally poor or not significant because 2,4-D mineralization was only weakly associated with measured 2,4-D sorption parameters and soil properties. As such, regional variations in herbicide sorption coefficients should be measured or calculated based on soil properties, to assign distinct pesticide fate model input parameters when estimating 2,4-D off-site

RESULTS: Nineteen independent studies were included in the meta-analysis. CCB users were at increased skin cancer risk (SRR 1.14, 95% CI 1.07-1.21), and beta-blockers users were at increased risk of developing cutaneous melanoma (SRR 1.21, 95% CI 1.05-1.40), with acceptable between-studies heterogeneity (I2 < 50%).

Microsomal 3-hydroxylation was the major pathway of DZP metabolism in rats and was inhibited by anti-CYP3A antibodies. Purified CYP3As and CYP2C11 catalysed 3-hydroxylation and N-demethylation, respectively, in the reconstituted systems. The rates of both reactions in human liver microsomes depended on the substrate concentration: the rate of 3-hydroxylation was 3-4 times higher than N-demethylation at 0.2 mM; the two activities were essentially the same at a lower substrate concentration (0.02 mM). Inhibitions of the N-demethylation by anti-CYP2C antibody and 	S-mephenytoin	 also depended on the substrate concentration and was detectable only at a low substrate concentration. Kinetic studies revealed the presence of two distinct catalytic activities for the N-demethylation; low Km and low Vmax, and high Km and high Vmax. The former activity seems to be mediated by a CYP2C P450 form. On the other hand, DZP 3-hydroxylation was rather selectively catalysed by a CYP3A P450 at the low and high substrate concentrations. These results were consistent with the observation in vivo that DZP N-demethylation and S-mephenytoin 4'-hydroxylation are closely correlated in humans.

However, phenoxybenzamine )Pbz, 2 mg/kg) injected 30 min prior to the analog infusion diminished but did not completely abolish the initial pressor effect. In adrenalectomized rats, the pressor effect was reduced by approximately 50 percent and disappeared completely 15-30 min after start of the infusion.

In these rats no regular correlation was found between the angiotensin II ED20 values and initial blood pressure. These data indicate that under the present experimental conditions, the low pressor effect observed with these angiotensin II antagonists appears to be due to both adrenal catecholamine release and a direct vasoconstrictor effect.

Nine different murine anti-human C5a monoclonal antibodies have been produced and characterized. They exhibit Kas for the 125I-labeled ligand that range from 0.4 to 48 X 10(8) M-1, and they display limited cross-reactivity with C5a from other species. Each of these antibodies has been found to compete with the granulocyte C5a receptor for binding site(s) on the C5a polypeptide. Exploration of the antigenic topography of 	C5a	 revealed that the immunodominant portion of this glycopolypeptide resides between residues Lys20 and Arg37, with the area surrounding Cys27 being particularly important. In addition, a specific C5a derived tryptic peptide containing these amino acid residues competes with 125I-C5a for binding to the receptor. These observations are consistent with previously published data and suggest that this area of the C5a molecule is an important part of the receptor "recognition domain", and thus plays a critical role in the C5a receptor interaction.

However, in cells permeabilized to Ca2+ with 10 microM ionomycin, increases within this concentration range depressed the baseline levels of cAMP content. Furthermore, the stimulatory effects of both forskolin and isoproterenol on cAMP accumulation were significantly blunted in this concentration range. These blunting effects by Ca2+ were not the result of 	any measurable decrease	 in ATP content.

The computer model contained stimulus-response data sets obtained from frequency-of-seeing experiments in 11 normal subjects tested with each perimetric technique at four retinal locations [(0 degrees , 30 degrees ), (0 degrees , 15 degrees ), (0 degrees , - 15 degrees ), and (0 degrees , - 30 degrees )]. We programmed 	eight staircase procedures	 varying from a coarse one with one reversal to an elaborate procedure with four reversals to look at the relationship between accuracy (the difference between the estimated and actual threshold) and efficiency (number of presentations required for estimate) with each technique. Threshold estimates were made 100 times for each location, strategy, perimetric technique, and subject. Our results showed that an increase in accuracy was always coupled with a decrease in efficiency and that the relationship between these two parameters was similar between the two techniques. Some evidence, however, is presented to show that compared to conventional perimetry relatively simple staircase

We evaluated the antiemetic activity of resiniferatoxin, an ultrapotent capsaicin analogue, on cisplatin- and apomorphine-induced emesis in dogs, and on cisplatin-induced acute and delayed emesis in ferrets. In the dog, resiniferatoxin (10 microg/kg, s.c.) 30 min before the injection of cisplatin markedly prevented acute emesis induced by cisplatin. When animals were given resiniferatoxin (10 microg/kg, s.c.) 24 h prior to cisplatin, the emesis was still inhibited, but not significantly. Resiniferatoxin (10 microg/kg, s.c.) 30 min before the administration of 	apomorphine	 also significantly reduced the emetic responses induced by apomorphine in dogs. In the ferret, resiniferatoxin (10 microg/kg, s.c.) 30 min prior to cisplatin completely inhibited acute emesis caused by cisplatin (10 mg/kg, i.p.). When ferrets were given resiniferatoxin (10 microg/kg, s.c.) 16 h prior to cisplatin, the emesis was still significantly inhibited. Cisplatin (5 mg/kg, i.p.) induced both acute (0-24 h) and delayed (24-72 h) phase emesis, and a single injection of resiniferatoxin (10 microg/kg, s.c.) at 36 h after cisplatin significantly reduced subsequent emetic responses during the 36-72 h period.

24628291	T9	dis	DOCSTART Under-recognition of acral peeling skin syndrome: 59 new cases with 15 novel mutations. BACKGROUND: Acral peeling skin syndrome (APSS) is a rare skin fragility disorder usually caused by mutations in the transglutaminase 5 gene (TGM5). METHODS: We investigated the mutation spectrum of APSS in the U.K., Germany and Poland. RESULTS: We identified 59 children with APSS from 52 families. The phenotype was readily recognizable, with some variation in severity both within and between families. Most cases had been misdiagnosed as the localized form of 	epidermolysis bullosa simplex	 (EBS-loc). Eighteen different TGM5 mutations were identified, 15 of which were novel. Eight mutations were unique to a single family, nine each occurred in two families, while the common p.Gly113Cys mutation linked to a second missense variant p.Thr109Met occurred in 47 of the 52 families and was homozygous in 28. Most patients were of nonconsanguineous white European origin. CONCLUSIONS: We propose that APSS is under-reported and widely misdiagnosed as EBS-loc, with significant counselling implications as APSS is autosomal recessive while EBS-loc is dominant. We recommend screening for TGM5 mutations when EBS-loc is suspected but not confirmed by mutations in KRT5

Loss of the tooth would have complicated orthodontic treatment. Conventional periapical radiographs provided insufficient information about the nature of the invagination and its relation to the root canal to formulate an appropriate plan for treating the tooth.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed using a 1.5-T magnet with a phased-array coil and acquisition of T2-weighted single-shot fast spin echo (SSFSE) half Fourier sequences before intravenous administration of gadolinium, and T1-weighted fast spoiled gradient (FSPGR) fat-saturated sequences before and after contrast administration. Before the examination, patents received oral polyethylene glycol (PEG) (1,000 ml for adults; 10 ml/Kg of body weight for children). Regions of interest (ROI) were placed on the normal and diseased intestinal wall to assess 	signal intensity	 and rate of increase in contrast enhancement over time. Data were compared with the Crohn's Disease Activity Index (CDAI). RESULTS: The diseased bowel wall showed early and intense uptake of contrast that increases over time until a plateau is reached. In patients in the remission phase after treatment, signal intensity was only slightly higher in diseased bowel loops than in healthy loops. There was a significant correlation between the peak of contrast uptake and CDAI.

Dipyridamole and baseline myocardial blood flow indexes were assessed on G-SPECT imaging of (99m)Tc-tetrofosmin, with normalization of the myocardial count rate to the corresponding first-transit counts in the pulmonary artery. Coronary flow reserve (CFR) was defined as the ratio between dipyridamole and baseline myocardial blood flow indexes. In all patients, parathyroid hormone, 25-hydroxy vitamin D (25(OH)D) and 1,25(OH)(2)D serum levels were determined. RESULTS: Primary hyperparathyroidism was eventually diagnosed in 15 of the 23 patients. The mean 	25(OH)D	 concentration was relatively low (21 +/- 10 ng/mL) while the concentrations of 1,25(OH)(2)D varied widely but within the normal range (mean 95 +/- 61 pmol/L). No patient showed reversible perfusion defects on G-SPECT. CFR was not correlated with either the serum concentration of 25(OH)D nor that of parathyroid hormone, but was strictly correlated with the serum level of 1,25(OH)(2)D (R = 0.8, p < 0.01). Moreover, patients with a 1,25(OH)(2)D concentration below the median value (86 pmol/L) had markedly lower CFR than the other patients (1.48 +/- 0.40 vs. 2.51 +/- 0.63, respectively; p < 0.001).

Two distinct patterns of neutralization were identified from these GC antisera. Of all the serotypes tested, NCDV GC antisera neutralized only B641 to a relatively high titer compared with the homologous titer, implying a narrow pattern of NT response. Analysis with reassortants indicated that the response was primarily to VP4. In contrast, B223 GC antisera neutralized 	most	 of the G serotypes tested to titers within 3-7 fold of the homologous titer, demonstrating a broad pattern of NT response. In the earlier study B223 was shown to induce a heterotypic protection against bovine rotavirus B641 (G serotype 6), and the serologic data obtained from this study indicates that a B223 vaccine might provide broad protection against several different serotypes of human and animal rotaviruses.

For more than 20 years, the gut has been hypothesized to be the "motor" of multiple organ dysfunction syndrome. As critical care research has evolved, there have been multiple mechanisms by which the gastrointestinal tract has been proposed to drive systemic inflammation. Many of these disparate mechanisms have proved to be important in the origin and propagation of critical illness. However, this has led to an unusual situation where investigators describing the gut as 	a "motor"	 revving the systemic inflammatory response syndrome are frequently describing wholly different processes to support their claim (i.e., increased apoptosis, altered tight junctions, translocation, cytokine production, crosstalk with commensal bacteria, etc). The purpose of this review is to present a unifying theory as to how the gut drives critical illness. Although the gastrointestinal tract is frequently described simply as "the gut," it is actually made up of (1) an epithelium; (2) a diverse and robust immune arm, which contains most of the immune cells in the body; and (3) the commensal bacteria, which contain more cells than are present in the

Differences in demographic and laboratory data, including the procalcitonin level, were analyzed between the groups. We used the mortality rate during hospitalization as a marker of prognosis in patients with bacterial meningitis. Multiple logistic regression analysis showed that high serum levels of procalcitonin (>0.12ng/mL) were an independently significant variable for differentiating bacterial meningitis from 	viral meningitis	. The risk of having bacterial meningitis with high serum levels of procalcitonin was at least 6 times higher than the risk of having viral meningitis (OR=6.76, 95% CI: 1.84-24.90, p=0.004).

In contrast, 100 microg/ml nicotine significantly downregulated IL-1beta secretion by GMC relative to medium alone (p<0.008) and had no effect on PGE2 secretion by GMC.

Micro-computed tomography (muCT) possesses the resolution capable of detecting apparent bone density in extremely local regions and can characterize the trabecular structure. It has been asserted that this micro-structure is susceptible to micro-buckling and bending, which has a controversial role in predicting the global mechanical properties of bone. The current study measured the mechanical properties of relatively high apparent density bone from the equine distal third metacarpal. The mechanical properties were correlated with trabecular morphology parameters and apparent densities of localized regions obtained with muCT. These data were used to test 	two hypotheses	: (1) accounting for trabecular bending using trabecular morphology parameters would provide better global mechanical property predictions than using only apparent density, and (2) regions of low apparent density dominate the overall mechanical behavior and provide greater correlation to the measured mechanical properties than regions of high apparent density. The data indicated that accounting for trabecular bending with morphological parameters resulted in stronger correlations to mechanical properties than correlations that relied only on apparent density (r2= 0.91 versus r2= 0.81). Low apparent density regions were more strongly correlated with mechanical properties than high apparent density regions (r2= 0.85 versus r2= 0.77),

However, the absolute 8-oxodG levels in tissue DNA reported by various methods have been debated due to its artifactual production during DNA isolation and/or the DNA processing. We have investigated factors that may result in such artifacts during isolation and analysis of DNA as well as means for its prevention. 8-OxodG content was measured by a recently described TLC enrichment-mediated 32P-postlabeling. Liver DNA from 3 month-old, female Sprague-Dawley rats was isolated by a standard solvent-extraction procedure (	phenol	, phenol:Sevag, and Sevag; 23 degrees C), a modified solvent-extraction procedure (phenol:Sevag, and Sevag; 4 degrees C; KCl-SDS-protein precipitation) or sodium iodide extraction procedure. 8-OxodG was analyzed in the DNA by the 32P-postlabeling assay using a fluorescent light box during the workup, as well as in its absence. The 8-oxodG levels, when the fluorescent light box was used, were in similar range irrespective of the DNA isolation procedure (16.4+/-1.6 to 28.7+/-6 8-oxodG/10(6) nucleotides).

The effects of both drugs were schedule dependent: larger changes were evident in low response rate, reinforcement-lean components than in high response rate, reinforcement-rich components. Both effects were also time dependent, increasing over the course of the session; this casts serious doubt on the applicability of Herrnstein's matching law for studying agents acting on brain 	dopamine	. Increasing the period of food deprivation increased response rates, while withdrawing food deprivation decreased responding. These effects were also schedule dependent, but were time dependent. Substituting 95% sucrose pellets for standard 10% sucrose pellets caused an immediate and sustained decrease in responding, and up to 10% of earned reinforcement was not consumed. Pimozide increased response rates within reinforcement-lean components and reinstated the complete consumption of earned reward typical of standard reinforcement. These apparently paradoxical effects may be consistent with a decrease in the rewarding properties of sucrose pellets.

The firing rate of CO(2)-sensitive brainstem neurons cultured in microelectrode arrays was augmented by SP or a 5-HT2A receptor agonist, which was blocked by PKC inhibitors suggesting that PKC underscores the inhibitory effect of 	SP	 and 5-HT in cultured brainstem neurons as well. Immunostaining showed that both Kir4.1 and Kir5.1 proteins were co-localized in the cultured brainstem neurons.

Sporulation has been demonstrated in a number of different bacteria but Mycobacterium spp. have been considered to be non-sporulating bacteria. We recently provided evidence that 	Mycobacterium marinum	 and likely also Mycobacterium bovis bacillus Calmette-Guerin can form spores. Mycobacterial spores were detected in old cultures and our findings suggest that sporulation might be an adaptation of lifestyle for mycobacteria under stress.

OBJECTIVES: This study sought to investigate whether darbepoetin alfa, an erythropoiesis-stimulating protein (ESP), improves exercise capacity in patients with symptomatic chronic heart failure (CHF) and anemia. BACKGROUND: Anemia is common in patients with CHF. METHODS: In a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, CHF patients with 	anemia	 (hemoglobin > or =9.0 to < or =12.0 g/dl) received subcutaneous placebo (n = 22) or darbepoetin alfa (n = 19) at a starting dose of 0.75 microg/kg every 2 weeks for 26 weeks. The primary end point was change in exercise tolerance from baseline to week 27 as measured by peak oxygen uptake (ml/min/kg body weight). Other end points included changes in absolute peak VO2 (ml/min), exercise duration, and health-related quality of life. RESULTS: Differences (95% confidence interval) in mean changes from baseline to week 27 between treatment groups were 1.5 g/dl (0.5 to 2.4) for hemoglobin concentration (p = 0.005), 0.5 ml/kg/min (-0.7

Significant correlation of the HBeAg levels were observed between mothers' venous blood and neonates' venous blood, as well as neonates' cord blood with correlation coefficients of 0.362 and 0.352 (P < 0.000). However, there was no significant correlation of HBsAg levels between them (r = 0.023, 	P	 = 0.785; r = 0.04, P = 0.604). CONCLUSIONS: The HBV serological index of neonate's cord blood could reflect the HBV serological indexes in venous blood because of the good correlation and consistency between them. DOCEND

Comparisons of post-relapse survival (PRS) and post-progression survival have been used to measure efficacy in some 	cancer	 clinical trials. These comparisons are an attempt to account for second-line therapies and to identify benefits that do not translate in longer overall survival. However, the use of PRS comparisons can be misleading (either a longer or shorter PRS may indicate a benefit, depending on the circumstances) and can result in biased estimates (because of selection). Here, we describe the problems surrounding PRS comparisons and propose alternative approaches to deal with non-randomized therapies administered after progression to the experimental treatment.

Benzodiazepines are psychoactive substances classically used for their anticonvulsant properties in neonates as well as in adults. In a previous work, we have shown that seizures lead to an age-dependent upregulation of central benzodiazepine binding sites measured in isolated rat cerebral membranes. However, information concerning regional changes in the receptor density was lacking. In our present study, 	the effects	 of bicuculline-induced seizures were investigated by quantitative autoradiography of central benzodiazepine receptors in developing rats and in adults. Animals were killed 30 min after an intraperitoneal injection of either saline or a convulsive dose of bicuculline. Benzodiazepine binding sites in brain sections were labeled by [3H]flunitrazepam. Generalized seizures induced a widespread increase in benzodiazepine receptors, with a marked enhancement in structures that mediate seizure activity, such as substantia nigra, amygdala, septum, and hippocampus. The addition of exogenous gamma-aminobutyric acid to the incubation medium increased benzodiazepine binding by the same order of magnitude whether rats were given saline or bicuculline, suggesting

Treatment of symptomatic methemoglobinemia is by intravenous methylene blue (1-2 mg/kg) administration. Fifty-four cases of benzocaine-induced methemoglobinemia have been reported in the literature. Intubation, endoscopy/bronchoscopy, and ingestion were the most common procedures in which benzocaine administration produced methemoglobinemia. Infants and the elderly were more likely to develop toxic methemoglobinemia after benzocaine exposure. Other risk factors included genetic reductase deficiencies, exposure to high doses of anesthetic, and presence of denuded skin and mucous membranes. CONCLUSIONS: Because of the potential for severe complications, 	methemoglobinemia	 should be corrected promptly in compromised patients and those with toxic benzocaine concentrations. The possibility of masking symptoms during general anesthesia carries special risk of use of this agent in the preanesthesia setting. DOCEND

The mutations were cloned into a suicide shuttle plasmid containing the ptxptl operon and introduced into the adenylate cyclase locus of the chromosome of a Bordetella pertussis strain deleted for ptx. 	The wild-type ptxptl operon	 restored pertussis toxin expression and secretion. The ptl mutant constructs also restored expression of periplasmic pertussis toxin to the ptx deletion strain but the mutants had a statistically significant decrease in secretion of pertussis toxin of between 5- to 35-fold, suggesting all of the ptl genes must be intact for efficient pertussis toxin secretion. The mutations were also introduced into the adenylate cyclase locus of a wild-type ptxptl strain, resulting in a ptl diploid strain.

JMJD1C belongs to the family of jumonji C (jmjC) domain-containing histone demethylases and was originally described as a ligand-dependent co-activator of thyroid hormone and androgen receptors. Here, we explored the potential role of Jmjd1c in white adipocyte differentiation. To investigate the relevance of Jmjd1c in adipogenesis, murine 3T3-L1 preadipocyte cells with transient knock-down of Jmjd1c (3T3_Jmjd1c) were generated. Depletion of Jmjd1c led to the formation of smaller lipid droplets, reduced accumulation of triglycerides and maintenance of a more fibroblast-like morphology after adipocyte differentiation. Concomitantly, insulin stimulated uptake of 	glucose	 and fatty acids was significantly reduced in 3T3_Jmjd1c adipocytes. In line with these observations we detected lower expression of key genes associated with lipid droplet formation (Plin1, Plin4, Cidea) and uptake of glucose and fatty acids (Glut4, Fatp1, Fatp4, Aqp7) respectively. Finally, we demonstrate that depletion of Jmjd1c interferes with mitotic clonal expansion (MCE), increases levels of H3K9me2 (dimethylation of lysine 9 of histone H3) at promotor regions of adipogenic transcription factors (C/EBPs and PPARgamma) and leads to reduced induction of these key regulators. In conclusion, we have identified Jmjd1c as a modulator of adipogenesis. Our data suggest that Jmjd1c

Having a strategy ready to implement in advance or at the time when treatment decisions need to be made will facilitate and enhance the decision making process for both the health care team and family members. Here we introduce the individualized care planning and coordination (ICPC) model as a practical approach to facilitate ethical and effective decision making in pediatric SCT settings. The ICPC is a 3-step model comprising (1) relationship--understanding the illness experience from 	the perspective	 of the patient and family, sharing relevant information, and assessing ongoing needs; (2) negotiation--prognosticating, establishing goals of care, and discussing treatment options; and (3) plan--generating a comprehensive plan of care that includes life and medical plans. Based on a foundation of a care of competence, empathy, compassion, communication, and quality, the ICPC model aims to diminish contentious family-staff interactions that can lead to mistrust and help guide treatment decision making. The ICPC model enhances communication among patients, families, and clinicians by revealing patient and family values and medical and quality-of-life priorities before reaching or even during critical decision points in

The 85-kDa, as well as the 93-kDa, receptors bound to a monoclonal antibody raised against the transferrin receptor or to transferrin-Sepharose. In order to determine whether glycosylation was necessary for ligand binding, purified receptors were isolated from cells grown in the presence of tunicamycin. When K562 cells were grown in the presence of tunicamycin, an 80-kDa nonglycosylated form of the receptor was synthesized. This nonglycosylated receptor was also capable of dimer formation; however, much less of it reached the cell surface than the fully glycosylated form, although both untreated and 	tunicamycin	-grown cells appeared to synthesize transferrin receptors at similar rates. Although the number of receptor molecules/cell was similar in control and tunicamycin-treated cells, the nonglycosylated receptors exhibited a much lower affinity for transferrin than those of untreated cells; in contrast, when receptors were purified by immunoprecipitation and digested with bacterial alkaline phosphatase, no difference was observed between the affinity of these receptors and undigested immunoprecipitated receptors. These results suggest that glycosylation is not necessary for specific binding of transferrin to its receptor, but the affinity of this binding can be influenced greatly by the presence or absence of carbohydrate residues.

Approximately 20-50% of an apixaban i.v. dose was found in feces of BDC rats and dogs, suggesting IE leading to fecal elimination and intestinal clearance (IC). The fecal elimination, IC, and systemic clearance of apixaban were increased upon AC administration in both BDC rats and dogs and were decreased in BDC rats dosed with GF-120918, a dual BCRP and P-gp inhibitor). BCRP appeared to play a more important role for 	absorption	 and intestinal and renal elimination of apixaban than P-gp in transporter-KO rats after oral and i.v. dosing, which led to a higher level of active renal excretion in rat than other species. These data demonstrate that apixaban undergoes IE, EER, and RTR that are facilitated by efflux transporters. Intestinal reabsorption of apixaban could be interrupted by AC even at 3 hours post-drug dose in dogs (late charcoal effect). This study demonstrates that the intestine is an organ for direct clearance and redistribution of apixaban. The IE, EER, and RTR contribute to overall pharmacokinetic profiles of apixaban.

Our previous results utilizing DT40 cells containing a conditional TAF9 allele indicated that the histone 3-like TAF9 is essential for cell viability but largely dispensable for general transcription. In this study, we investigated further the role of TAF9 structural domains in TFIID integrity and cell growth and the functions of a TAF9-related factor, TAF9L. We first show that TAF9 depletion severely disrupts TFIID, indicating that the observed ongoing transcription is initiated with at least partially 	TAF	-free TATA-binding protein. We also provide evidence for specific roles of TAF HFMs, highlighting the functional significance of HFM specificity observed in vitro and, importantly, of the TAF9-histone 3 similarity. Although we provide evidence that TAF9 and TAF9L are partly redundant, RNA interference experiments suggest that TAF9L is essential for HeLa cell growth. Strikingly, we provide evidence that TAF9L plays a role in transcriptional repression and/or silencing. DOCEND

Conditioning of ganglia with high-frequency stimulation (15 Hz) for 45 min followed by a 15 min rest increased their ACh content by 45%. The appearance of this "rebound ACh" showed sensitivity to nucleoside transport inhibitors; it was prevented by dipyridamole, but not by NBTI or 	meclonazepam	, and it was reduced in the presence of RO 11-3624, suggesting an involvement of NBTI-resistant transporters. The effect of dipyridamole was specific for the synthesis of rebound ACh in that it did not inhibit ACh release or ACh synthesis during stimulation. The inhibitory action of dipyridamole on the synthesis of rebound ACh was not evident if it was present only during the tetanic stimulation but it was if dipyridamole was present during the rest period following it, suggesting that adenosine's presence after tetanic stimulation is of importance.

BACKGROUND: The experience with inpatient LVAD support as a bridge to transplantation has proved 	the efficacy	 of such therapy in improving circulatory hemodynamic status, restoring normal end-organ function and facilitating patient rehabilitation. With miniaturization of the power supplies and controllers, such mechanical circulatory support can now be accomplished in an outpatient setting. METHODS: Between March 1993 and February 1997, 32 patients (26 male, 6 female, mean [+/-SEM] age 49 +/- 15 years) underwent implantation of the ThermoCardiosystems (TCI) Heartmate vented electric (VE) LVAD. The VE LVAD is powered by batteries worn on shoulder holsters and is operated by a belt-mounted system controller, allowing unrestricted patient ambulation and hospital discharge. RESULTS: Mean duration of support was 122 +/- 26
1745051	T13	ggp	DOCSTART p53 alterations in all stages of breast cancer. Overexpression of the nuclear phosphoprotein p53 is one of the most frequently detected abnormalities in human cancer and appears to be associated with mutation of the p53 gene. In this study of breast cancer, p53 overexpression was detected in two (15%) of 15 pure intraductal tumors, 73 (25%) of 291 primary invasive carcinomas, 13 (50%) of 26 lymph nodes containing metastatic breast cancer, and two of four established breast cancer cell lines. Sequence analysis of selected specimens confirmed that 	p53	 overexpression was associated with mutation of the gene, while no mutations were detected in specimens without p53 overexpression. Thus, overexpression of p53 occurs in all stages of breast cancer and is consistently associated with the production of mutant proteins. Immunohistochemical analysis is a simple method which reliably predicts the presence of most p53 gene mutations in breast cancer specimens. DOCEND

Since then, searching for potent and specific small molecules able to modulate normal and mutated CFTR has become a crucial endpoint in the field for both our understanding of the physiological role that CFTR plays in epithelial cells and more importantly for the development of therapeutic agents to cure cystic fibrosis (CF). It is predicted that a pharmacological approach would help not only to restore the defective transport activity of mutant CFTR but also to correct the regulatory function of CFTR. This review describes 	the evolution	 of CFTR pharmacology and how during the last five years, high throughput screening assays have been developed to identify novel molecules, some of them probably constituting a reservoir of future therapeutic agents for CF.

We studied the analytical and clinical performance of six methods for creatine kinase (EC 2.7.3.2) isoenzyme MB (CK-MB): three immunoassays (Behring, Hybritech, and International Immunoassay Labs); one immunoinhibition assay (Roche); one immunoinhibition/column method (Du Pont); and one electrophoretic method (Beckman). Between-day precision for all kits was poor at the upper reference limit. All methods gave results linearly related to CK-MB concentration and all were free from CK-MM, 	CK-BB	, and adenylate kinase interference. Only the Du Pont method was adversely affected by atypical isoenzymes. For diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction in a coronary care population (n = 40; prevalence = 45%), all methods were approximately 95% efficient, when appropriate reference criteria were used. Some manufacturers fail to provide data for an appropriate (acutely ill, non-infarct) reference population; decreased diagnostic specificity may result from use of reference ranges based on results for healthy subjects. Expression of CK-MB as a percent of total CK degrades efficiency unless total CK is markedly increased. DOCEND

Odds ratios were adjusted for patient demographics, comorbidities, preoperative laboratory values, and operative factors. The association between SSI and other 30-day outcomes such as mortality and graft failure was determined. RESULTS: Of 12,330 patients who underwent revascularization, 1367 (11.1%) were diagnosed with an SSI within 30 days. Multivariate predictors of SSI included female gender (odds ratio [OR], 1.4; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.3-1.6), obesity (OR, 2.1; 95% CI, 1.8-2.4), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (OR, 1.2; 95% CI, 1.0-1.5), dialysis (OR, 1.5; 95% CI, 1.1-2.1), preoperative hyponatremia (OR, 1.2; 95% CI, 1.0-1.4), and 	length	 of operation >4 hours (OR, 1.4; 95% CI, 1.2-1.6). SSI was associated with prolonged (>10 days) hospital stay (OR, 1.8; 95% CI, 1.4-2.1) and higher rates of 30-day graft loss (OR, 2.3; 95% CI, 1.7-3.1) and reoperation (OR, 3.7; 95% CI, 3.1-4.6). SSI was not associated with increased 30-day mortality. CONCLUSION: SSI is a common complication after open revascularization and is associated with a more than twofold increased risk of early graft loss and reoperation. Several patient and operation-related risk factors that predict postoperative SSI were identified, suggesting that targeted improvements in perioperative care may decrease complications and improve outcomes

RESULTS: With 70% coverage of a single-age cohort of infants and pre-adolescent girls, the lives saved with rotavirus (~274,000) and HPV vaccines (~286,000) are similar, although the timing of averted mortality differs; rotavirus-attributable deaths occur in close proximity to infection, while HPV-related cancer deaths occur largely after age 30. Deaths averted per 1000 vaccinated are 5.2 (rotavirus) and 12.6 (HPV). Disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) averted were ~7.15 million (rotavirus) and ~1.30 million (HPV), reflecting the greater influence of discounting on the latter, given the lagtime between vaccination and averted 	cancer	. In most countries (68 for rotavirus and 66 for HPV, at the cost of I$25 per vaccinated individual) the incremental cost per DALY averted was lower than each country's GDP per capita. Financial resources required for vaccination with rotavirus are higher than with HPV since both genders are vaccinated. CONCLUSIONS: While lifesaving benefits of rotavirus and HPV vaccines will be realized at different times, the number of lives saved over each target populations' lifetimes will be similar. Model-based analyses that use a standardized analytic approach and generate comparable outputs can enrich the priority-setting dialogue. Although new vaccines may be deemed

Nephrectomy produced a significant increase in RRF concentration in the hypothalamus, suggesting that RRF neurons respond to decreased renin activity or other kidney-related substances in the circulation. The determination of RRF in peripheral tissue revealed minimal renin-releasing activity in the liver, spleen and skeletal muscle extracts. High performance chromatography of hypothalamic extract on a GPC-100 column revealed RRF activity in fractions that were estimated to have a molecular weight of 5,000. These studies suggest that RRF-containing cell bodies in the hypothalamus respond to depolarization by releasing RRF into the circulation. In 	addition	, the hypothalamic content of RRF is regulated by the kidney. Altogether, these data suggest that RRF neurons are part of a neuroendocrine system that regulates renin secretion from the kidneys. DOCEND

The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of NRP2945 on seizure activity induced by pentylenetetrazol (PTZ) in rats. Using behavioural assessment and electrocorticographical recordings, the effects of different doses of NRP2945 (5-20 microg/kg) were tested on seizure attacks induced by PTZ injection.

Large differences in plasma lipid and lipoprotein concentrations were found among these groups, providing the opportunity to examine their relationships to postheparin lipolytic activities (PHLA) including lipoprotein lipase (LPL) and hepatic triglyceride lipase (HTGL). PHLA was measured in plasma drawn 20 minutes after injection of heparin (100 units/kg). The assay was done with a radioactive triglyceride emulsion, and LPL and HTGL activities were estimated after 1 M NaCl inhibition of the former. LPL activity was high in both species of monkeys, and HTGL activity was low; the ratio of HTGL/LPL was consistently less than 0.5. 	The mean values	 for LPL activity did not vary significantly among experimental groups, but significant negative correlations between LPL activity and plasma triglyceride concentration were found. Statistically significant diet, species, and gender differences in HTGL activities were found. In high-fat-fed compared to low-fat-fed animals, HTGL activities were higher, and high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol concentrations and the percentages of HDL2b were also higher. African green monkeys had consistently higher HTGL activities than cynomolgus monkeys and had higher concentrations of HDL cholesterol and a greater proportion of HDL as the larger HDL2b subfraction.

All solutions were at 38 degrees C, with isotonic and the hypertonic NaCl solutions also given at 18 degrees C (cold isotonic and cold hypertonic). Fluorescent labeled albumin was given intravenously, and the change in fluorescence in the fluid was measured during each 15-min period. Changing from warm isotonic to cold isotonic decreased Dtr and Ptr. Changing from warm isotonic to warm hypertonic or hypertonic glucose decreased Ptr with no change in Dtr. The cold hypertonic responses were not different from cold isotonic responses. Warm hypertonic solution increased albumin flux into

Drosophila SNF2-type ATPase CHD1 catalyzes the assembly and remodeling of nucleosomal arrays in vitro and is involved in H3.3 incorporation in viin vivo during early embryo development. Evidence for a role as transcriptional regulator comes from its colocalization with elongating RNA polymerase II as well as from studies of fly Hsp70 transcription. Here we used microarray analysis to identify 	target genes	 of CHD1. We found a fraction of genes that were misregulated in Chd1 mutants to be functionally linked to Drosophila immune and stress response. Infection experiments using different microbial species revealed defects in host defense in Chd1-deficient adults upon oral infection with P. aeruginosa but not upon septic injury, suggesting a so far unrecognized role for CHD1 in intestinal immunity. Further molecular analysis showed that gut-specific transcription of antimicrobial peptide genes was overactivated in the absence of infection in Chd1 mutant flies. Moreover, microbial colonization of the intestine was elevated in Chd1 mutants and oral infection resulted in strong enrichment

These attributes have been shown to be important in the choice of insurance contract. Using statistical design optimization procedures, the number of choice sets was reduced to 27 and randomly split into three groups. One choice was included twice to test for consistency.

Therefore, these analogues are not appropriate for studying the mechanisms of epilepsy, which is believed to be based on the functional changes of the brain. On the other hand, although GLU and ASP themselves have minimal neurotoxic action, a relatively higher dosage than that of their analogues is needed to produce epileptic seizures. A recent report, in which Freeman has found that combined GLU/ASP released from the lobster neuromuscular synapse in a molar ratio of 1:3 (GLU/ASP) produces strong excitation, may provide some clue to this problem.

The effect of changing ambient temperature on skin temperature was recorded in human subjects; also, its effect on blood flow was measured using venous occlusion and optical plethysmography. When cold stimulus was removed in stages using a heating cabinet, it was found that a biphasic flow response occurred in the fingers with each step change in temperature. There was a rapid transient rise followed by a decline to an equilibrium flow level. The transient rise occurred even when the temperature rose from 37 to 40 degrees C, although at this level 	the equilibrium	 remained unchanged. It is suggested that the transient rise was due to stimulation of Hensel's dynamic warmth receptors, whereas the rise in equilibrium temperature was due to removal of cold stimulus, which at low ambient temperatures maintains reflex vasoconstriction through activation of static cold receptors. Upper arm skin responded to removal of cold stimulus by a fall in temperature. Immersion of a different limb in cold water produced vasoconstriction in fingers but vasodilatation in the upper arm skin. It is suggested that this may be due to neurogenic vasodilatation, though the present work gives no indication as to pathways. DOCEND

Lopinavir/Ritonavir was dissolved in 1% ethanol (vehicle) and injected into mini-osmotic pumps that were surgically implanted into Wistar rats for 8 weeks vs. vehicle and sham controls. We subsequently evaluated metabolic parameters, gene/protein markers and heart function (ex vivo Langendorff perfusions). PI-treated rats exhibited increased serum LDL-cholesterol, higher tissue triglycerides (heart, 	liver	), but no evidence of insulin resistance. In parallel, there was upregulation of hepatic gene expression, i.e. acetyl-CoA carboxylase b and 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA-reductase, key regulators of fatty acid oxidation and cholesterol synthesis, respectively. PI-treated hearts displayed impaired cardiac contractile function together with attenuated UPS activity. However, there was no significant remodeling of hearts exposed to PIs, i.e. lack of ultrastructural changes, fibrosis, cardiac hypertrophic response, and oxidative stress. Western blot analysis of PI-treated hearts revealed that perturbed calcium handling may contribute to the PI-mediated contractile dysfunction. Here chronic PI administration led to elevated myocardial calcineurin, nuclear factor of activated T-cells 3 (NFAT3),

SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomized controlled clinical trials (RCTs) of prostaglandin analogues (PA), H2-receptor antagonists (H2RA) or proton pump inhibitors (PPI) for the prevention of chronic NSAID induced upper GI toxicity were included. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two independent reviewers extracted data regarding population characteristics, study design, methodological quality and number of patients with endoscopic ulcers, ulcer complications, symptoms, overall drop-outs, drop outs due to symptoms. Dichotomous data was pooled using Revman V3.1. Heterogeneity was evaluated using a chi square test. MAIN RESULTS: 	Thirty-three RCTs	 met the inclusion criteria. All doses of misoprostol significantly reduced the risk of endoscopic ulcers. Misoprostol 800 ug/day was superior to 400 ug/day for the prevention of endoscopic gastric ulcers (RR=0.18, and RR=0. 38 respectively, p=0.0055). A dose response relationship was not seen with duodenal ulcers. Misoprostol caused diarrhea at all doses, although significantly more at 800ug/day than 400ug/day (p=0.0012). Misoprostol was the only prophylactic agent documented to reduce ulcer complications. Standard doses of H2RAs were effective at reducing the risk of endoscopic duodenal (RR=0.24; 95% CI: 0.10-0. 57) but not gastric ulcers(RR=0.73; 95% CI:0.50-1.09). Both double dose H2RAs and

These endotoxin-binding extracts did not block serologically active groupings on endotoxins or receptors on the erythrocytes. The specificity of these still crude materials was less that that of the highly purified erythrocyte lipopolysaccharide receptor previously described by us, since they bound some bacterial antigens not related to endotoxins. Depending on source, the n-butanol extracts contained 40 to 52% glycerophosphatides (most active), 15 to 22% sphingomyelin, 17% cholesterol, less than 2 to 5% triglycerides, and 7 to 13% inactive peptide. The most active substances in the 	n-butanol	 extract were soluble in petroleum ether, whereas the peptide and sphingomyelin were not. Thus, no constituent protein, carbohydrate, or nucleic acid was present in the most highly active material. Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of the petroleum ether-soluble material showed for each extract one lipid band only, which was well defined and migrated similarly to phosphatidyllipids. Because of the lipidic nature of the inhibitory substances from leukocytes and platelets we also tested the lipid A component of bacterial endotoxins and some of its derivatives. Lipid A inhibited endotoxin coating of erythrocytes. De-O-acylation of lipid A left amide-linked 3-D-hydroxymyristic acid intact and increased

Regression analysis revealed that current inflammatory bowel disease-related symptoms, current perceived social support, and maladaptive coping behaviors at the time of surgery each made a highly significant independent contribution to postsurgical quality of life. The sensitivity of the Medical Outcomes Study Social Support Scale in identifying patients with poor postsurgical quality of life was 81 percent, and the specificity was 77 percent. The negative predictive value was 93 percent. CONCLUSIONS: Three coping behaviors which seem to be maladaptive (self-control, self-blame, and escape) are associated with lower quality of life after surgery for inflammatory bowel disease. These coping behaviors make 	a contribution	 to postsurgical quality of life independent of the negative effect on quality of life of inflammatory bowel disease symptoms. Perceived social support is a third factor that makes an independent contribution to postsurgical quality of life. The Medical Outcomes Study Social Support Scale has properties associated with an effective screening tool and merits further investigation as an instrument to screen presurgically for individuals at higher risk of poor subjective outcome of inflammatory bowel disease surgery.

The prevalence of late potentials was significantly higher in patients with than without ventricular tachycardia/fibrillation (65 vs 22%; p less than 0.01). These relations persisted among patients with 	left bundle branch block	, although a different definition was used for identifying late potentials in these patients.

The clinical efficacy and tolerability of halofantrine, a new antimalarial schizontocide, was studied in a multi-centre trial involving 268 patients ranging in age from 6 months to 58 years. The patients were suffering from acute uncomplicated malaria due to either P. vivax or P. falciparum. Patients were treated orally with 3 doses of 	halofantrine hydrochloride	, 500 mg/6-hourly in adults or 8 mg/kg body weight 6-hourly in children. The overall cure rate was 96.9%. The mean fever clearance time for different species was as follows: P. vivax--39.1 hours, P. falciparum--43.2 hours, mixed infection--60.0 hours, and the mean parasitaemia clearance times were 47.7, 55.1 and 72.0 hours, respectively. Recrudescence was reported in 11 (4.1%) patients, although all of them were parasite-free on Day 7 post-treatment. No haematological or biochemical abnormalities were noted.

The purpose of this study was to characterize further the signal transduction mechanism of the 5-HT2B receptor in rat stomach fundus. Nitrendipine (1 microM) inhibited the maximal contraction to 5-HT (10 microM) by approx. 60%. 5-HT contractions were inhibited by approximately the same magnitude in the absence of extracellular calcium as in the presence of nitrendipine, indicating that calcium influx through voltage-dependent calcium channels accounted fully for the dependence of the 5-HT contraction on extracellular calcium. 	Depletion	 of both extracellular calcium and intracellular calcium stores abolished 5-HT contraction. Ryanodine (30 microM), an inhibitor of calcium release from internal stores, inhibited significantly the nitrendipine-insensitive 5-HT contraction, suggesting that this component of the contraction was due to calcium release from a ryanodine-sensitive site. Bisindolylmaleimide (5 microM), a specific inhibitor of protein kinase C (PKC), inhibited 5-HT contraction in either the absence or presence of nitrendipine, suggesting that activation of PKC is also important. Taken together, these data indicate that the 5-HT2B contractile receptor in the rat stomach fundus is coupled to calcium influx through voltage-dependent calcium channels, intracellular calcium

At the start of omeprazole treatment (T0) and at the latest follow-up visit (T1), serum was obtained for measurement of cobalamin. Corpus biopsy specimens were obtained at entry and follow-up for histopathological scoring according to the updated Sydney classification. RESULTS: At inclusion, none of the 49 patients had signs of atrophic gastritis. During follow-up, 15 patients (33%) developed 	atrophic gastritis	, nine of whom had moderate to severe atrophy. These 15 patients did not differ from the other 34 patients with respect to age, serum cobalamin at T0 or the duration of follow-up.

Parent's literacy, place of living and type of cryptorchidism had no significant relation with delay diagnosis (p> 0.05). CONCLUSION: These results revealed that late diagnosis by physician and lack of insight of parents are the main reasons in delayed diagnosis and treatment of UDT. Therefore, education of parents and careful physical examination of the babies at birth and regular follow-up until 18 months can prevent the delay in diagnosis. DOCEND
2478796	T6	che	DOCSTART Adrenoceptor-mediated changes of excitation and contraction in isolated heart muscle preparations. The inotropic effects of sympathetic stimulation on the heart are mainly ascribed to the activation of beta-adrenoceptors. However, several findings suggest that alpha-adrenoceptors also may help mediate the inotropic response to catecholamines under certain conditions. The onset of the positive inotropic effect mediated by beta-adrenoceptors occurs within seconds and is associated with a faster rate of relaxation. Both beta 1- and beta 2-adrenoceptors are stimulatorily coupled to the enzyme adenylate cyclase, thereby leading to the generation of 	cyclic AMP	. Cyclic AMP increases the slow inward calcium current and enhances the uptake of calcium into the sarcoplasmic reticulum. GTP-binding protein Gs is important for the transmembrane signal transduction. Muscarine and adenosine receptors are inhibitorily coupled to adenylate cyclase, thereby decreasing the inotropic response to catecholamines. Another GTP-binding protein, Gi, is involved in this pathway. The stimulation of the myocardium through the activation of alpha-adrenoceptors seems to differ both qualitatively and quantitatively. Myocardial alpha-adrenoceptors of most species are, if existent, predominantly of the alpha 1-subtype; the functional role of these receptors obviously considerably varies among species.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) DOCEND

The aim of the present investigation was to study the role of fibronectin and insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) in pathogenesis of primary open-angle and pseudoexfoliative glaucoma. Immune enzyme analysis was performed on aqueous humour of 480 patients with complicated cataracts on the background of primary open-angle and pseudoexfoliative glaucoma. The aqueous humour of patients with senile cataracts was used as control. The content of fibronectin and IGF-1 in aqueous humour was determined using appropriate kits (DRG-International Inc., USA) in the absorbance wavelength range 420-450 nm. The obtained results were analyzed using Student's criteria and 	application	 of SPSS-13/80. Relatively high levels of fibronectin and IGF-1 were recorded in aqueous humour of patients with complicated cataracts (cataracts on the background of open-angle and pseudoexfoliative glaucoma), as compared to indices of both cytokines in the aqueous humour of control group patients. In mechanisms of eye drainage function impairment and intraocular pressure increase an important role belongs to in situ (i.e. in the eye membranes) produced fibronectin and IGF-1. DOCEND

Mice are resistant to aflatoxin carcinogenicity primarily due to expression of a glutathione S-transferase (mYc) with high catalytic activity toward aflatoxin B1-8,9-epoxide (AFBO). In contrast, rats are more sensitive to aflatoxin carcinogenicity due to the constitutive expression of a glutathione S-transferase with relatively low catalytic activity toward AFBO (rYc1). To identify the contribution of different regions of the mYc protein that confer high catalytic activity toward AFBO, six chimeric 	mYc	/rYc1 GST enzymes were generated utilizing full and partial restriction enzyme digestions at two conserved StyI sites in the mYc and rYc1 complementary DNAs (between amino acid residues 56-57 and 142-143). Recombinant wild-type and chimeric glutathione S-transferases were bacterially expressed, affinity purified, and their catalytic activities measured toward AFBO, delta 5-androstene-3,17-dione, 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene, and ethacrynic acid. The set of chimeras displayed a wide range of catalytic activities toward the substrates assayed. The chimeras with the greatest activity toward AFBO were 1:56rat-57: 221mouse and 1:56mouse-57:142rat-143:221mouse, with AFBO conjugating activities 200 and 8 times greater than wild-type rYc1, respectively.

OBJECTIVE: To analyze the enhancement of the prostate using ultrasmall superparamagnetic iron oxide (USPIO)-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging in patients with prostate cancer. METHODS: Sixty patients were enrolled. The signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) of the central and peripheral zones (CZ and PZ, respectively) of the prostate were evaluated on T2- and T2*-weighted magnetic resonance imaging before and 24 hours after USPIO-enhanced MRI. The changes in SNR after USPIO-enhanced MRI were analyzed and correlated with serum prostate-specific antigen and 	histopathologic Gleason scoring	 based on surgically removed prostate gland. RESULTS: Decrease in SNR was noted in each zone of the prostate after USPIO-enhanced MRI (P < 0.001). Mean SNR decrease in the CZ was higher than that in the PZ (P < 0.05). High-grade prostate cancer was associated with a higher decrease in SNR (P < 0.05). The SNR change was negatively correlated with serum prostate-specific antigen at low or intermediate levels (P < 0.05).

Levels of movement activity were used to identify two groups of rats: those with high- and low-activity levels. Blockade of dopamine receptors with haloperidol led to suppression of locomotor activity in both groups of rats; in common snails, haloperidol decreased the rate of locomotion. The excitability of spinal centers in rats decreased 5 min after single i.v. injections, with gradual recovery seen by 30 min. Chronic administration of haloperidol suppressed post-tetanic potentiation of the H response in the gastrocnemius muscle of spinal rats. Prolonged use of 	haloperidol	 induced significant hyperpolarization of the membrane potential of command neurons in common snails and increased the action potential generation threshold.

Intermediate levels of CFTR and cotransporter expression in bronchial epithelium diminished in bronchioles. The low abundance of CFTR mRNA throughout murine pulmonary epithelium is consistent with functional data that attributes Cl(-) secretion predominantly to an alternative Cl(-) channel. alpha-ENaC as the only mRNA found in 	all regions	 of airway epithelia is consistent with the alpha-subunit as requisite for Na(+) absorption, and the increased expression of alpha-, beta-, and gamma-ENaC in distal airways suggests a greater absorptive capability in this region.

The tet(M) gene was detected in relation with conjugative transposons in 10 out of 36 enterococci isolates analyzed but not in any of E. coli isolates positive for tet(M). Southern blot showed that in E. coli and in most of the enterococci isolates the tet(M) gene was carried on a plasmid. According to the phylogenetic analysis, E. coli contained a new tet(M) allele grouping separately. Mating experiments revealed that tet(M) was carried on a mobile element successfully transferred between enterococci and between enterococci and E. coli. CONCLUSIONS: The detection of tet(M) in E. coli isolates from 	pigs	 was higher than expected.

Recent reports indicate that this apoptotic activity of rituximab can be synergized by cotreatment with Fas agonists. Here, we report on a strategy designed to exploit and optimize the synergy between rituximab and Fas signaling by genetically fusing a rituximab-derived antibody fragment to soluble Fas ligand (sFasL). The resultant fusion protein, designated scFvRit:sFasL, potently induced CD20-restricted apoptosis in a panel of malignant B-cell lines (10 of 11) and primary patient-derived malignant B cells (two of two non-Hodgkin lymphoma and five of six B cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia). ScFvRit:sFasL efficiently activated 	CD20	 and Fas apoptotic signaling, resulting in a far superior proapoptotic activity compared with cotreatment with rituximab and Fas agonists. ScFvRit:sFasL lacked activity toward normal human B cells and also lacked systemic toxicity in nude mice with no elevation of aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase levels or liver caspase-3 activity. In conclusion, scFvRit:sFasL efficiently activates CD20 and Fas-apoptotic signaling and may be useful for the elimination of malignant B cells. DOCEND

By contrast the role of estrogens during early steps of metastasis, involving cell invasion through the basement membrane and cell motility is more controversial. The motility of several estrogen receptor (ER) positive breast (MCF7, T47D) and ovarian (BG-1, SKOV3, PEO4) cancer cell lines were studied in 	our laboratory	 using a modified Boyden chamber assay. We observed, in all cases, estradiol-induced inhibition of cancer cell invasion and motility. A similar inhibitory effect of estradiol was found when the wild-type ER was stably transfected in the ER-negative MDA-MB231 cells and 3Y1-Ad12 cancer cells. The mechanism of this inhibitory effect is unknown. In ovarian cancer, however it may involve intermediary proteins such as fibulin-1, an extracellular matrix protein that strongly interacts with fibronectin and which is induced by estrogen and secreted by ovarian cancer cells. In breast cancer cells other estrogen regulated proteins may be involved. We conclude that estrogens in

However, the thymi of lightly infected mice which survived 20 weeks of infection did not differ in histology or total tissue mass from age-matched uninfected controls. Adult thymectomy at 3 weeks of infection did not abrogate the spontaneous modulation (diminution) of granuloma formation in 20-week infected mice, although spleen cells from these 	mice	 failed to adoptively transfer suppression. Heavily infected mice which did not survive beyond the acute phase (8 to 9 weeks) of infection displayed a diminished granulomatous response that was partially restored by thymectomy carried out at 5 to 6 weeks of infection.

We found that recombinant tryptase, human mast-cell (HMC-1) supernatant, which contains tryptase, and the PAR2-activating peptide SLIGKV exert fibroproliferative actions in human fibroblasts. Here we report insights into this action, which after activation of PAR2 leads to increased expression of cyclooxygenase 2 (COX2), a key enzyme in the biosynthesis of prostaglandins, and consequently to enhanced prostaglandin synthesis. Subsequent cell proliferation is mediated by the prostaglandin 15-deoxy-Delta(12,14)-prostaglandin J(2), which acts via the nuclear peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma). Fibroblast proliferation induced by tryptase and 	PAR2	 agonist peptide can be blocked by antagonists of COX2 and PPARgamma, implying that the proliferative effect of tryptase is PAR2-initiated but depends on COX2, 15-deoxy-Delta(12,14)-prostaglandin J(2), and PPARgamma. This previously uncharacterized pathway could be of relevance for human fibrotic diseases. For instance, increased numbers of activated mast cells are correlated with fibrosis in testes of infertile men. In these cases all components of the signaling pathway of tryptase were detected as well as expression of COX2. Therefore, our study describes as-yet-unknown interactions between mast cells and fibroblasts, which could be relevant for human fibrotic diseases. DOCEND

Thoracic aortic banding of these mice led to a 20-fold increase in the endogenous ANF mRNA in 	the ventricle	 but no detectable expression of the T-antigen marker gene.

Loss-of-miR-497 function significantly suppresses OGD-induced N2A cell death, whereas gain-of-miR-497 function aggravates OGD-induced neuronal loss. Moreover, miR-497 directly binds to the predicted 3'-UTR target sites of bcl-2/-w genes. Furthermore, knockdown of cerebral miR-497 effectively enhances bcl-2/-w protein levels in the ischemic region, attenuates ischemic brain infarction, and improves neurological outcomes in 	mice	 after focal cerebral ischemia. Taken together, our data suggest that miR-497 promotes ischemic neuronal death by negatively regulating antiapoptotic proteins, bcl-2 and bcl-w.

Transcription of an algD-lacZ chromosomal fusion in E. coli was detected upon introduction of plasmid-borne algU mucA mucB. Moreover, insertional inactivation of either mucA or mucB resulted in further stimulation of transcriptional activity from the algD promoter. This activation was dependent on algU, since a double algU mucA mutation abrogated transcription of algD. These experiments suggest that 	the phenotypic manifestations	 of muc mutations, i.e., increased algD expression and mucoid phenotype, depend on the presence of an active algU gene and that this regulator and the factors encoded by the downstream genes interact. Further support for these conclusions came from the investigations of the mechanism of reversion to nonmucoidy in P. aeruginosa, a phenomenon frequently referred to as the instability of mucoid phenotype.

Intravenous lidocaine infusions did not significantly influence the release of any of the measured eicosanoids versus saline. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, the lack of effect of intravenous lidocaine could relate to the severe burn trauma inducing rapid ischaemia which may have interfered with the delivery of the agent to the burned tissues or to insufficient concentrations achieved in the burn area. Topical treatment of burned skin with a local anaesthetic cream significantly reduced the release of TXB2 and 6-Keto-PGF1alpha, suggesting 	a possible mechanism	 of action in progressive burn ischaemia.

Infection with varicella zoster virus (VZV) is often considered a childhood 'right of passage'; however, primary infection occurring in women of child-bearing age can have significant adverse consequences both for the mother and for her fetus. During the first trimester, primary 	VZV	 infection may result in stillbirth or a baby born with the stigmata of the congenital varicella syndrome, while infection in the peripartum period can result in neonatal varicella, which carries a significant mortality rate despite appropriate antiviral therapy. Varicella in pregnant women can progress to pneumonitis and other severe sequelae that may also compromise the viability of the fetus. Exposure to VZV most commonly occurs in the community or from children in the household, but occasionally, exposure may occur in the hospital environment.

Eight weeks after implantation, walking track analysis showed a significantly higher sciatic function index (SFI) score (P<0.05) and better toe spreading development in the laser-treated group than in the sham-irradiated control group. For electrophysiological measurement, both the mean peak amplitude and nerve conduction velocity of compound muscle action potentials (CMAPs) were higher in 	the laser-treated group	 than in the sham-irradiated group. The two groups were found to be significantly different during the experimental period (P<0.005). Histomorphometric assessments revealed that the qualitative observation and quantitative analysis of the regenerated nerve tissue in the laser-treated group were superior to those of the sham-irradiated group. Thus, the motor functional, electrophysiologic and histomorphometric assessments demonstrate that LLL therapy can accelerate neural repair of the corresponding transected peripheral nerve after bridging the GGT nerve guide conduit in rats.

Nowadays, the current and specific instrument to assess this symptom is the Aberrant Salience Inventory (ASI) both in clinical and non-clinical samples. Furthermore, the documented interrelation between the dysregulation of the salience attribution and the 	dopamine	 system could explain the correlation between aberrant salience, substance abuse and development of psychotic symptoms.

Studies in our laboratory and others have indicated that endotoxin is present in a high percentage of human middle ear effusions, including those that are culture negative. Endotoxin has been identified as one of the most potent inducers of tumor necrosis factor (TNF), but this relationship has not been investigated in regard to the pathogenesis of otitis media. The purpose of this study was to determine whether endotoxin induces the production of TNF in the middle ear. 	Otitis media	 was induced in chinchillas by the injection of isolated lipopolysaccharide and middle ear fluids (MEFs) and serum harvested and assayed for TNF content by means of a cytolytic assay using L-929 cells and the Cell Titer 96 assay (Promega, Madison, WI). The MEF pools' TNF concentration ranged from 200 to 1,100 pg/mL MEF. Serum pools did not contain any detectable TNF. The results of the present study suggest that endotoxin induces TNF production locally in the middle ear cleft, which may contribute to the pathogenesis of otitis media via any number of established inflammatory pathways.

In addition, a stem-loop structure in the mRNAs coding for selenoproteins is essential to mediate the selection of the proper selenocysteine UGA codon. Interestingly, in eukaryotic selenoprotein mRNAs, this stem-loop structure, the selenocysteine insertion sequence (SECIS) element, resides in the 3'-untranslated region, far downstream of the UGA codon. In view of unravelling the underlying complex mechanism, we have attempted to detect RNA-binding proteins with specificity for the SECIS element. Using mobility shift assays, we could show that 	a protein	, present in different types of mammalian cell extracts, possesses the capacity of binding the SECIS element of the selenoprotein glutathione peroxidase (GPx) mRNA. We have termed this protein SBP, for Secis Binding Protein. Competition experiments attested that the binding is highly specific and UV cross-linking indicated that the protein has an apparent molecular weight in the range of 60-65 kDa. Finally, some data suggest that the SECIS elements in the mRNAs of GPx and another selenoprotein, type I iodothyronine 5' deiodinase, recognize the same SBP protein.

RESULTS: Brimonidine was found to be highly selective for the alpha2A adrenoreceptor (EC50 0.45nM) over the other alpha-adrenoreceptors. Additionally, the large target profiling study demonstrated the high selectivity of brimonidine with minimal off-target effects. The ex vivo wire myography model showed that brimonidine is a potent vasoconstrictor of human subcutaneous vessels with a diameter of less than 200mum (EC50 0.4nM). The ex vivo human skin biopsy neuroinflammation model demonstrated that 	brimonidine	 completely inhibited vasodilation induced by capsaicin. Both in vivo mouse ear inflammation models highlighted that brimonidine inhibited ear edema (up to 76%) when compared to vehicle.

Studies in model organisms suggest that the expression levels of most genes evolve under stabilizing selection, although a few are consistent with adaptive evolution. However, it has been proposed that gene expression levels in primates evolve largely in the absence of selective constraints. In this article, we discuss the microarray-based observations that led to these disparate interpretations. We conclude that in both primates and model organisms, stabilizing selection is likely to be the dominant mode of gene expression evolution.

We also found that application of human GDNF enhanced the cell migration ability of human oral cancers. Moreover, treatment with GDNF increased matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9 and MMP-13 expression in oral cancer. Inhibition of MMP-9 and MMP-13 in oral cancer cells by pharmacological inhibitors or neutralizing antibodies reduced GDNF-enhanced cell migration. Moreover, transfection with siRNA against MMP-13 inhibited GDNF-enhanced cell migration. Treatment with GDNF also increased ERK, p38 and JNK phosphorylation, and AP-1 DNA binding activity in 	human	 oral cancer cells. Inhibition of MAP kinase or AP-1 also reduced GDNF-induced oral cancer cell migration. In migration-prone sublines, oral cancer cells showed a higher migration ability than that of the original oral cancer cells. Surprisingly, the enhancement of cell migratory activity in migration-prone sublines was reduced by a GDNF-neutralizing antibody. Importantly, migration-prone sublines of oral cancer revealed higher GDNF expression. CONCLUSION: These results indicate a regulatory effect on cell migration by GDNF in oral squamous cancer. DOCEND

The level of AS mRNA paralleled AS enzyme activity, as well as the AS protein level detected by Western blotting and by in situ immunostaining. Cytotoxicity tests in vitro showed that the AS mRNA level also synchronized with cellular resistance to L-asparaginase in cell lines. Cellular levels of AS enzyme activity correlated with resistance to L-asparaginase. These results indicate that the AS mRNA level is an index of resistance to L-asparaginase. RQ-PCR is superior to enzyme assays, Western blotting, and immunostaining in 	the following ways	: less labor and time, accurate and reproducible quantitativity, and broad dynamic range. In addition, RQ-PCR could evaluate differences in L-asparaginase sensitivity although immunostaining could not. And in clinical samples, we analyzed eight pediatric leukemia cases by this RQ-PCR to evaluate whether this method was applicable to clinical laboratories and the expression level of AS mRNA in each case were predictable for the effectiveness of L-asparaginase treatment. Consequently, this method was useful enough in defining candidates for selective therapy that targets an AS deficiency. DOCEND

High mobility group B1 (HMGB1) and its counter-receptor, receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE), represent suitable targets for investigation, integrating many aspects of modern biology, particularly that associated with chronic diseases involving inflammation, dysregulated cell death and cancer. Also known as amphoterin, HMGB1 was initially identified over 25 years ago as a transcriptional regulatory molecule causing DNA bending, and facilitating binding of several transcriptional complexes, in particular members of the nuclear hormone receptor family. Although loosely bound to chromatin, it is released from necrotic cells but not apoptotic cells and is actively secreted by 	activated macrophages	 in a partially tumor necrosis factor-dependent manner. It serves as a late mediator of septic death present within the serum and inflammatory sites of patients with arthritis, correlating with the inflammatory response, to signal tissue injury, causes sickness behavior, and acts as an endogenous pyrogen. Although known to interact with RAGE on endothelial cells causing activation and leukocyte recruitment, RAGE itself has most recently been shown to serve as a counter-receptor for leukocyte integrins, suggesting that signaling through this molecule is potentially important for cell adhesion and clustering as well as recruitment of inflammatory cells.

Single channel studies showed that Pb2+ reduced the frequency but not the lifetime of the NMDA-activated single channel currents. Further evaluation of the mechanism of action of Pb2+ on the NMDA receptor demonstrated that this cation is a noncompetitive antagonist of both NMDA and glycine. We have demonstrated that the NMDA-induced whole cell currents change along with cell development, and the effects of Pb2+ are also dependent upon age of culture. The NMDA-induced currents in cultured rat hippocampal neurons had 	two components	, one that decayed rapidly and another that decayed slowly. The fast component was clearly observed at concentrations of glycine higher than 1 microM, whereas the slow component reached its maximum amplitude at the glycine concentration of 1 microM. Moreover, the rapidly decaying component of NMDA-evoked whole cell currents was predominant in young cultured neurons, and its contribution to the total current was reduced in old cultured neurons.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) DOCEND

Esophageal, skin, clothing, and ambient temperatures, as well as dew-point temperatures near the skin, in the clothing and in the environment were monitored. In addition, evaporation of sweat and sweat accumulated in the clothing were determined. The temperatures and water vapour pressures in all clothing layers varied significantly with the human thermoregulatory responses (skin temperature, sweating) to alternating work/rest cycles. Different courses of localized corresponding temperatures and water vapour pressures indicated that various forms of heat transport and heat exchange in the skin-clothing-environment system are of significance in different body areas.

Photoisomerization of rhodopsin's chromophore, 11-cis-retinal to all-trans-retinal, leads to the formation of the activated photoproduct metarhodopsin II (Meta II). Subsequently, Meta II initiates the excitation events by activating many copies of the rod cell-specific G-proteins (Gt or transducin). To terminate the signal, the long-lived Meta II must be quenched. Deactivation of Meta II involves phosphorylation by rhodopsin kinase followed by the binding of arrestin. In order to recycle rhodopsin for phototransduction, arrestin must dissociate, and the chromophore must be replaced. In this study, we show that the reduction of the photolyzed chromophore 	all-trans-retinal	 to all-trans-retinol is essential for recycling photoactivated rhodopsin. Once this reduction has occurred, the arrestin blockade of the receptor is removed, the chromophore site becomes accessible for regeneration, and the phosphates can be hydrolyzed. If the reduction does not occur, we demonstrate that free all-trans-retinal can react with the apoprotein to form pseudo-photoproducts that are spectrally identical to the photoinduced metarhodopsin species (Meta I/II/III). The Meta II-like product, M380, interacts tightly with arrestin and kinase, however, it does not measurably interact with Gt. The persistent blockade by arrestin and the low affinity for Gt together prevent activation of the visual

The natural and reconstructed joints had similar patterns of translation, with larger rotations and translations observed in the passive model. On the average, the active translations of the natural joints were best reproduced by the reconstructed joints with 	less conforming articulations	. The mean active translation in the natural joints was 1.5 millimeters along the anterior-posterior axis and 1.1 millimeters along the superior-inferior axis. The active translations in the reconstructed joints were observed to increase consistently as the conformity of the components decreased: the mean active anterior-posterior translations ranged from 0.3 millimeter for conforming components to 1.7 millimeters for components with a five-millimeter radial mismatch, and the mean active superior-inferior translations ranged from 0.4 to 1.1 millimeters. The patterns of translation during passive motions were less consistent, presumably because of the influence of capsular ligaments and because the translations were large enough

Recently, high-throughput techniques have been applied to detect dozens or even hundreds of candidate genes. However, experimental approaches to validate the many candidates are usually time-consuming, tedious and expensive, and sometimes lack reproducibility. Therefore, numerous theoretical and computational methods (e.g. network-based approaches) have been developed to prioritize candidate disease genes. Many network-based approaches implicitly utilize the observation that genes causing the same or similar diseases tend to correlate with each other in gene-protein relationship networks. Of these network approaches, the random walk with restart algorithm (RWR) is considered to be a state-of-the-art approach. To further improve

Of the 30 evaluable patients, CPC was considered to be successful in 13 (43.3%), including 8 of 20 patients with severe hydrocephalus and 5 of 10 with hydranencephaly. 	Failure	 of CPC was evident from increased head circumference in 14 (82%) of 17 patients and from CSF leakage in 3. Of the 17 failures, 13 occurred within 3 months of surgery. Six patients died: 3 whose CPC procedures were failures, 2 whose CPC was successful, and 1 postoperatively. Of the 17 in whom CPC failed, 10 subsequently underwent VP shunt insertion. CONCLUSIONS: CPC stabilizes macrocephaly in approximately 40% of infants with severe congenital hydrocephalus and hydranencephaly and can be considered as an alternative to VP shunt placement. DOCEND

BACKGROUND: Intestinal ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) is a complex phenomenon causing destruction of both local and remote tissues, as well as multiple-organ failure. We investigated the role of lipid peroxidation in damage to intestinal, liver, and lung tissues in this pathology. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The superior mesenteric artery was blocked for 30 min followed by 24 h of reperfusion. Tissues were removed and the presence of oxidized LDL, the activities of the superoxide dismutase enzyme, malondialdehyde levels, and inducible 	nitric oxide	 synthase expression were each evaluated in the intestinal, liver, and lung tissues. RESULTS: While there was no staining in the control group tissues, ischemia/reperfusion resulted in positive oxidized LDL staining in all of the I/R test group tissue samples. Inducible nitric oxide synthase expression was significantly increased in the ischemia/reperfusion group tissues. Compared with those of the control group rats, the ischemia/reperfusion group tissues showed significantly higher malondialdehyde levels and lower superoxide dismutase activities. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated for the first time that oxidized LDL accumulated in the terminal ileum, liver, and lung tissues after intestinal ischemia/reperfusion. This occurrence (or

Diphtheria toxin (DT) binds to the epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like domain of human membrane-anchored heparin-binding EGF-like growth factor (proHB-EGF), the human DT receptor (DTR). DT does not bind to mouse proHB-EGF because of amino acid substitutions within the EGF-like domain. We made 10 independent mutants, replacing a single amino acid within the EGF-like domain of 	human	 DTR/proHB-EGF with the corresponding amino acid residue in mouse proHB-EGF. The mutant proteins were transiently expressed in mouse L cells either expressing or not expressing DRAP27/CD9, and DT binding was measured. DT binding activity of GST fusion proteins containing the mutated EGF-like domain was also determined by a cell-free binding assay. The largest effect was seen with E141H, and second largest effects were seen with F115Y and L127F in all of the assay systems. We conclude that Phe115, Leu127, and Glu141 are critical amino acid residues for DT binding. A computer model of the tertiary structure of the EGF-like domain

Mutation of PEST residue threonine 225 stabilizes Ho, yet HoT225A still binds Ufo1 in vitro. Stable HoT225A accumulates within the nucleus, whereas HoT225E is degraded. Deletion of the nuclear exportin Msn5 traps native Ho in the nucleus and extends its half-life. These experiments suggest that Ho is degraded in the cytoplasm. In mec1 mutants stable Ho accumulates within the nucleus; Ho produced in mec1 cells does not bind Ufo1. Thus the MEC1 pathway has 	functions	 both in phosphorylation of Thr-225 for nuclear export and in additional phosphorylations for binding Ufo1. Cells with HO under its genomic promoter, but stabilized by deletion of the Msn5 exportin, proliferate, but are multibudded. These experiments elucidate some of the links between the DNA damage response and degradation of Ho by the ubiquitin system. DOCEND

Multiple regression analyses were used to test variables' prediction of fear of recurrence and breast cancer survivor self-efficacy, as well as breast cancer survivor self-efficacy mediation effects. MAIN RESEARCH VARIABLES: Fear of recurrence, breast cancer survivor self-efficacy, and age at diagnosis. FINDINGS: Survivors diagnosed at a younger age had significantly higher fear of recurrence, as well as health, role, womanhood, death, and parenting worries. Perceived risk of 	recurrence	, trait anxiety, and breast cancer reminders explained significant variance in fear of recurrence and breast cancer survivor self-efficacy. Breast cancer survivor self-efficacy partially mediated the effects of variables on fear of recurrence. CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest that breast cancer survivor self-efficacy may have a protective effect for survivors who are younger at diagnosis and have higher perceived risk of recurrence, higher trait anxiety, and more breast cancer reminders.

When the samples were excited by the 415 nm light, it was found that two fluorescence bands in the region of shorter wavelength disappeared and the intensity of the fluorescence band of 515 nm was enhanced.

The current standard therapy for 	XLH	--high-dose phosphate and calcitriol--further increases FGF23 concentrations, suggesting that patients with XLH may have an altered response to extracellular phosphate. To test for the presence of abnormal phosphate responsiveness, we compared serum biochemistries and femoral Fgf23 mRNA expression between wild-type mice, murine models of XLH (Phex(K496X)) and hyperphosphatemic tumoral calcinosis (Galnt3(-/-)), and Galnt3/Phex double-mutant mice. Phex mutant mice had not only increased Fgf23 expression but also reduced proteolytic cleavage of intact Fgf23 protein, resulting in markedly elevated intact Fgf23 levels and consequent hypophosphatemia. In contrast, despite markedly increased Fgf23 expression, Galnt3 knockout mice had significantly high proteolytic cleavage of Fgf23

Alpha-naphthoflavone (ANF), an inhibitor of CYP 2C and 1A, had no significant effect on AQ4N metabolism.

Rainbow trout, as well as many other species of fish, demonstrate the ability to survive starvation for long periods of time. During starvation, growth rate is decreased and muscle exhibits signs of wasting. However, upon resumption of feeding, accelerated growth is often observed. Alterations in muscle metabolism occur during feed restriction and refeeding, although the ways in which these alterations affect the molecular pathways that control muscle growth have not been fully determined. To analyze changes in muscle metabolism and growth during starvation and refeeding, real-time PCR was used to test 	the expression	 of six metabolic-related genes and eight muscle-specific genes in rainbow trout white muscle prior to and after 30 days of starvation, and after 4 and 14 days of refeeding. The six metabolic-related genes chosen are indicative of specific metabolic pathways: glycolysis, glycogenesis, gluconeogenesis, the pentose phosphate pathway, and fatty acid formation. The eight muscle specific genes chosen are key components in muscle growth and structural integrity, i.e., MRFs, MEFs, myostatins, and myosin. Alterations in expression of the tested metabolic-related genes and muscle-specific genes suggest that during both starvation and refeeding, changes in specific metabolic pathways initiate shifts in muscle that

In experiments where SHBG promoter-luciferase reporter gene constructs were co-transfected into HepG2 cells with COUP-TF and/or HNF-4 expression vectors, HNF-4 markedly increased transcription, whereas COUP-TF suppressed this probably by displacing HNF-4 from their common FP1-binding site. This COUP-TF/HNF-4-binding site within FP1 includes a TTTAA sequence, located at nucleotides -30/-26 upstream of the transcription start site, which fails to interact with 	human	 TFIID, TATA-binding protein in vitro. When this sequence was replaced with an idealized HNF-4-binding site, the transcriptional activity of the promoter increased in HepG2 cells. Taken together, these data imply that an interplay between COUP-TF and HNF-4 at a site within FP1 regulates human SHBG expression and that HNF-4 controls transcription from this TATA-less promoter by somehow substituting for TATA-binding protein in the recruitment of a transcription preinitiation complex.

APL is characterized by three distinct and unique features: i) the accumulation in the bone marrow of tumor cells with promyelocytic features; ii) the invariable association with specific translocations which always involve chromosome 17 and the Retinoic Acid Receptor alpha (RAR alpha) locus; iii) the exquisite sensitivity of APL blasts to the differentiating action of Retinoic Acid (RA). These features have led APL to become the paradigm for therapeutic approaches utilizing differentiating agents. The last 5 years have provided 	crucial insights	 into the molecular basis of APL.

The data are from the National Ambulatory Care Reporting System, an administrative database, and represent 4.3 million patient visits made to 163 Ontario EDs between 	April 2003 and March 2004	. Among these data, the proportion that left without being seen (LWBS) was 3.1% (136,805). The rate of LWBS was highest among patients aged 15 to 35 years, those with less acute conditions and facilities that handle the highest volume of patients. Facility rates were positively correlated with facility median ED length of stay, annual facility volume and percentage of inpatient admissions. Understanding patient and facility characteristics that increase rates of LWBS may inform the process of developing measures to ensure timely access to ED care for all who seek it. DOCEND

The present study investigated the postmortem brain mRNA and immunohistochemical expressions of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta), inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and nuclear factor erythroid-2-related factor-2 (Nrf2) in forensic cases. Relative mRNA quantification using Taqman real-time PCR assay demonstrated higher expression of IL-1beta, 	TNF-alpha	 and iNOS, and lower expression of Nrf2 in methamphetamine intoxication and hyperthermia cases, higher expression of iNOS in phenobarbital intoxication cases, and higher expression of Nrf2 in phenobarbital intoxication and hypothermia cases.

21094781	T41	out	DOCSTART Medical students' knowledge about organ transplantation: a South African perspective. BACKGROUND: Educating physicians about transplantation during undergraduate training can improve organ procurement rates. The aim of this study was to evaluate and analyze the knowledge of medical students regarding transplantation. METHODS: A previously validated self-administered anonymous questionnaire was distributed to all medical students. RESULTS: Of the 346 participants, 217 (63%) were preclinical students. Their mean age was 21 years (range, 18-33) and 62% were women. Twenty-nine (8%) students were registered as organ donors. One third of all study participants received formal transplantation teaching; 	a greater proportion	 of clinical students received teaching compared with the preclinical group (52% vs 22%, P < .05). Knowledge was frequently reported for kidney (88%), liver (81%), bone marrow (78%), and heart (76%) transplantation. Small Intestine (13%), pancreas (9%), and pancreatic islets (4%) were the least recognized organs/tissues. Ninety-six percent and 62% of respondents were aware of kidney and liver living-donor transplants, respectively; the 27% of students with an interest in a surgical career had better knowledge of living-donor transplantation (P < .05). Only 22 (6%) students knew which solid organ transplants were performed in South Africa. CONCLUSION: Medical students have limited knowledge about

Its small diploid genome and resistance to environmental stress make sorghum an attractive model for studying the functional genomics of the Saccharinae and other C4 grasses. We analyzed the domain-based functional annotation of the cDNAs using the gene ontology (GO) categories for molecular function to characterize all the genes cloned in the full-length cDNA library of sorghum. The sorghum cDNA library successfully captured a wide range of cDNA-encoded proteins with various functions. To characterize the protein function of newly identified cDNAs, a search of their deduced domains and comparative analyses in the Oryza sativa and 	Zea mays	 genomes were carried out. Furthermore, genes on the sense strand corresponding to antisense transcripts were classified based on the GO of molecular function. To add more information about these genes, we have analyzed the expression profiles using RNA-Seq of three tissues (spikelet, seed and stem) during the starch-filling phase. We performed functional analysis of tissue-specific genes and expression analysis of genes of starch biosynthesis enzymes. This functional analysis of sorghum full-length cDNAs and the transcriptome information will facilitate further analysis of the Saccharinae and grass families. DOCEND

In the present study, genome-wide mining and expression analysis of ACBP genes was performed on Hevea brasiliensis (the para rubber tree), the most important latex-producing crop in the world.

We have studied the in vivo DNA ligation in three lymphoblast cell lines from Werner syndrome patients and three from normal donors. In our host cell ligation assay we transfected linearized plasmid pZ189 and measured the amount of plasmid DNA ends rejoined by these host cells as the ability of the recovered plasmid to transform bacteria. A mutagenesis marker gene close to the ligation site allowed screening for mutations. Subsequent mutation analysis provided information about the accuracy of the ligation process. The cells from 	Werner syndrome	 patients were as effective as normal cells in ligating DNA ends. However, mutation analysis revealed that the three Werner syndrome cell lines introduced 2.4-4.6 times more mutations (p < 0.001) than the normal cell lines during ligation of the DNA ends: the mutation rates were 69.4, 97.2, and 58.7%, as compared to 23.6, 21.7, and 24.4% in the normal cell lines. These increased mutation frequencies in plasmids ligated during passage through Werner syndrome cells were mainly due to a significant (p < 0.001) increase in deletions. This error-prone DNA ligation might be responsible for the spontaneous hypermutability and the genomic instability in

Sonography	 has been especially valuable for women with mammographically dense breast because it has consistently been able to detect a substantial number of cancers at an early stage. Despite these findings, breast sonography has known limitations as a screening tool; operator-dependence, the shortage of skilled operators, the inability to detect microcalcifications, and substantially higher false-positive rates than mammography. Further study of screening sonography is still ongoing and is expected to help establish the role of screening sonography. DOCEND

METHODS: Nineteen injection workers were compared with a group of 104 other tunnel workers with similar exposure, except for that to synthetic resins. A questionnaire on respiratory symptoms, smoking habits, use of respiratory protection, and work tasks was used. Lung function was studied using a bellows spirometer. Bronchial reactivity was tested with methacholine. Allergy screening with Phadiatop and radioallergosorbent tests for toluene-diisocyanate-HSA, diphenylmethane-4.4-diisocyanate-HSA, and formaldehyde-HSA (HSA = human serum albumin) were carried out. 	Methylene diphenyl diisocyanate	 (MDI) and MDI prepolymer exposure was estimated by filter sampling, and the filters were analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography. The most common work situations were simulated for an estimation of exposure to isocyanates. RESULTS: The injection workers reported more respiratory symptoms than the reference group, and they had higher prevalences of bronchial hyperresponsiveness (37% versus 14%), asthma (26% versus 1%), and airflow limitation (37% versus 4%).

Keratinocytes grown in 0.1 mM calcium serum-free medium (which prevents differentiation) were more sensitive to both the stimulatory and inhibitory effects of IFN gamma than keratinocytes grown in 1.2 mM calcium serum-free medium (which permits differentiation). The stimulatory effect of IFN gamma on 1,25-(OH)2D production was maximal after 2 days of incubation. Incubations longer than 2 days showed increasingly less stimulation at the low IFN gamma concentrations and increasingly greater inhibition at the higher IFN gamma concentrations. The inhibitory effects of IFN gamma on 1,25-(OH)2D production paralleled the inhibitory effects of 	IFN gamma	 on cell growth. Thus, IFN gamma does regulate 1,25-(OH)2D production by keratinocytes. However, this regulation is modulated by the state of keratinocyte proliferation and differentiation and is influenced by calcium and undefined factors in serum. The data are consistent with the possibility that IFN gamma alters keratinocyte differentiation in part by regulating 1,25-(OH)2D production. DOCEND

The structure of the catalytic subunit with the fixed positioning of the activation segment in the active conformation through its own aminoterminal region suggests a regulation at the transcriptional level making a regulation by second messengers unlikely. The high conservation of the catalytic subunit from yeast to man and its role in the tetrameric complex supports this notion. The regulatory beta-subunit has been far less conserved throughout evolution. Furthermore the existence of different CK2beta-related proteins together with the observation of deregulated 	CK2beta	 levels in tumor cells and the reported association of CK2beta protein with key proteins in signal transduction, e.g. A-Raf, Mos, pg90rsk etc. are suggestive for an additional physiological role of CK2beta protein beside being the regulatory compound in the tetrameric holoenzyme.

Higher neutralization titres were observed in sera from LS compared to the AIDS group, with a significant difference for HIV1MN and HIV1LAI strains.

Finally, we found that phospho-Akt levels were elevated in CF lung epithelial cells and were specifically lowered by either antagomir-155 or elevated expression of SHIP1. We therefore suggest that elevated miR-155 contributes to the proinflammatory expression of IL-8 in CF lung epithelial cells by lowering 	SHIP1	 expression and thereby activating the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway.

Nonuniform matrix ion suppression/enhancement across different types of samples in an analytical run is widely believed to be well compensated for by using a stable isotope-labeled internal standard (SIL-IS) in bioanalysis using liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Therefore, the risk of nonuniform matrix ion suppression/enhancement is usually deemed low when an SIL-IS is used.

The failure was attributed to different extents of matrix ion enhancement between the standards (STDs) and QCs, which resulted in the misaligned results from the regression model.

Age related changes in the dynamics of accommodation (far to near focus) and disaccommodation (near to far focus) are reported in this study. 	Dynamic responses	 to step stimulus demands from 1D to 6D, in 1D steps, were recorded with a PowerRefractor in 66 subjects in the age range 14-45 years. The accommodative and disaccommodative responses were fit with exponential functions to calculate response amplitude, time constant and peak velocity. The latency of accommodation did not change and the latency of disaccommodation increased with age. For accommodation, time constant increased and peak velocity decreased with age. For disaccommodation, no change in time constant or peak velocity was found with age. The form of the peak velocity vs response amplitude relationship (main sequence) of accommodation changed with

Between January 1997 and April 2005, 140 patients (120 males and 20 females, aged 23-71 years) with severe haemoptysis considered surgically inoperable because of limited pulmonary reserve were treated by embolisation. The cause of haemoptysis was tuberculosis in 136 patients and malignancy in four. Embolisation succeeded in controlling haemoptysis immediately after the intervention in 138 patients (98.5%) and at 1 month in 126 patients (90%). Severe haemoptysis recurred in 11 patients with prior massive haemoptysis and 3 patients with prior moderate haemoptysis in a mean time of 3.7 months (1-7 months) after the last intervention. 	The bleeding source	 was detected during angiography and embolised in 12 of these patients. Two patients with malignant tumour died because of abundant bleeding, following an asymptomatic period of 30 days. There were no procedure-related major complications.

Previous studies have demonstrated that herbicides with a low soil organic carbon partition coefficient (K(oc)) are preferentially removed from concrete and asphalt surfaces. It is possible, therefore, that sorption may play a role in retaining herbicides to hard surfaces. This study provides an indication of the extent to which herbicides may sorb to concrete and asphalt, and examines the results in the light of other research to identify the significance of sorption in describing herbicide losses after application. There was measurable sorption of herbicides to 	concrete	 and asphalt although this was limited compared with that to soils, especially for concrete. An exponential relationship between experimentally derived values of K(p) and literature values of K(oc) for asphalt was established (r(2) = 0.931); there was a weaker relationship for concrete (r(2) = 0.606). The experimentally derived K(p) values could be used to enhance the prediction of herbicide loss to receiving waters following application. It is probable that the fate of herbicides applied to concrete and asphalt surfaces depends more heavily on physical processes than is the case in soils. DOCEND

Primary human endothelial cells were treated with low doses of the proteasome inhibitor MG132 for 2 h, and proteomic analysis of nuclear extracts was performed. Using a 2-D differential in gel electrophoresis (DIGE) approach, we identified more than 24 splice factors to be differentially regulated by low dose proteasome inhibition. In particular, several isoforms of hnRNPA1 were shown to be increased, pointing toward altered posttranslational modification of hnRNPA1 upon proteasome inhibition. Elevated levels of splice factors were associated with a different alternative splicing pattern in response to proteasome inhibition as determined by Affymetrix exon array profiling. Of 	note	, we observed alternative RNA processing for stress associated genes such as caspases and heat shock proteins.

In this study we have investigated the roles of superoxide and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) activation in 	MMP-9	 induction following exposure to IL-1 beta. IL-1 beta stimulated biphasic ERK activation in vascular smooth muscle (VSM) cells, a transient activation that reached a maximum at 15 min and declined to baseline levels within 1 h, and a second phase of sustained ERK activation lasting up to 8 h. To determine the role of ERK in IL-1 beta-stimulated MMP-9 induction, we treated cells with the specific ERK pathway inhibitor PD-98059 at different time intervals after IL-1 beta stimulation. Addition of PD-98059 up to 4 h after IL-1 beta stimulation significantly inhibited MMP-9 induction, suggesting a role for sustained ERK activation

The mGluRs are expressed widely in the PFC and striatum, regions often implicated in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. Thus, we hypothesized that abnormal expression of mGluRs might contribute to glutamatergic dysfunction observed in the PFC and striatum in schizophrenia. Accordingly, we measured the expression of metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) in Brodmann areas 9, 11, 32, and 46 in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and the caudate, putamen, and nucleus accumbens in schizophrenia (	16 cases	, 9 controls) by Western blot analysis. We found an increase in the expression of mGluR1a and mGluR2/3 immunoreactivity in the PFC in schizophrenia, while no changes in the expression of mGluR4a or mGluR5 were detected in this region. In the striatum we found no changes in the expression of any of the mGluRs studied. These results suggest that alterations of mGluR1a and mGluR2/3 expression in the PFC may contribute to the pathophysiology of schizophrenia, and support targeting these receptors for the generation of novel treatment modalities for this disabling illness.

OBJECTIVE: Iron fortification of flour has been sanctioned by the Brazilian government since 2004. The objective of the study was to assess the impact of flour fortification on hemoglobin level in children under six. METHODS: A time-series study was carried out in Pelotas, southern Brazil, consisting of three assessments at a 12-month interval. In May 2004, before flour fortification, hemoglobin measurements were obtained in a probabilistic sample of 453 children. 	Twelve and 24 months	 later, samples of 923 and 863 children were studied, respectively. RESULTS: The three groups studied were comparable in terms of demographic and socioeconomic characteristics. At baseline, mean hemoglobin was 11.3 +/- 2.8 g/dL. In the post-fortification period, means were 11.2 +/- 2.8 (at 12 months) and 11.3 +/- 2.5 g/dL (at 24 months), with no statistically significant difference among the three time periods studied (p=0.16). CONCLUSIONS: Fortification had no effect on hemoglobin levels of the children studied. This finding could be partially due to inadequate flour intake and/or low bioavailability of dietary iron.

In the same condition, aspirin (100 micrograms/g) only slightly prolonged the time required for occlusion (193.2 +/- 13.2 s). In a model of fatal pulmonary thromboembolism induced by intravenous injection of ADP (300 micrograms/g), YC-1 was effective in reducing mortality when administered intraperitoneally at doses of 10-30 micrograms/g. The antithrombotic effect of YC-1 was correlated with the inhibition of ADP-induced platelet aggregation ex vivo. In contrast, 	aspirin	 (30, 100 micrograms/g) did not inhibit ADP-induced pulmonary thromboembolism in vivo or platelet aggregation ex vivo. YC-1 (3, 10 micrograms/g) also exhibited profibrinolytic activity ex vivo, as revealed by shortening of the euglobulin clot lysis time. Therefore, YC-1 is an effective antithrombotic agent in preventing thrombosis in animal models, and its antiaggregating and additional profibrinolytic effects may be of potential clinical benefit in the treatment of thromboembolic diseases.

After stimulation, cell surface GLUT4 labeling is increased by as much as 40-fold. GLUT4 is chronically regulated by altered gene expression. Neural and/or contractile activity regulates GLUT4 expression in muscle: 1) GLUT4 levels differ among muscles of different fiber type; 2) GLUT4 levels in muscle are increased with exercise training and decreased with denervation; and 3) cultured muscle cells, which lack an intact nerve supply, express very low levels of GLUT4. 	GLUT4	 expression appears to be regulated in parallel with many oxidative enzymes in muscle, suggesting that there may be a unified developmental program that determines the overall metabolic properties of a particular muscle.

This paper reports the hydrophobicity, determined as log partition coefficient (P) by 	the shake-flask method	, of 25 nucleoside analogues. The capacity factors (k') of these analogues were also obtained by reversed-phase liquid chromatography. There is a very strong linear correlation between the log P and the log k' values of all the nucleoside analogues, indicating that hydrophobicity of nucleosides can be determined by liquid chromatography. Examination of the P data indicates that an empirical mathematical relationship exists between the partition coefficient value and the molecular structure of the nucleoside analogues.

The characteristics of protein tyrosine phosphorylation were examined in Rat-1 fibroblasts in response to endothelin-1 (ET-1) and 1-oleoyl-lysophosphatidic acid (LPA). Both agonists stimulated the biphasic tyrosine phosphorylation of at least three major proteins of approx. 120 kDa (pp116, 	pp120	 and pp130) and two of 80 kDa (pp80 and pp70). Immunoprecipitation experiments indicated that the pp120 protein corresponded to the recently described focal adhesion protein kinase pp125fak. Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, alone or in combination with the calcium ionophore A23187, also stimulated the phosphorylation of pp125fak but to a smaller extent than LPA or ET-1. Removal of both extracellular and intracellular Ca2+ did not significantly reduce LPA- and ET-1-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of pp125fak. In cells where protein kinase C activity was down-regulated or inhibited, ET-1-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of pp125fak was reduced to a greater extent than phosphorylation in response to LPA.

Two major physiological roles for the pineal hormone melatonin (MEL) have been identified in vertebrates: the hormone influences circadian rhythmicity and regulates seasonal responses to changes in day length. These effects of MEL are thought to be due to interaction with specific, high affinity MEL receptors in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) and hypophysial pars tuberalis (PT), respectively. Using the ligand 2-[125I]iodo-MEL ([125I]MEL), we examined putative MEL receptors in these regions in 	human	 and monkey tissue specimens by in vitro autoradiography. Specific, high affinity [125I]MEL-binding sites (Kd, 53.3 +/- 13.0 pM) were consistently observed in the human SCN. In contrast, specific [125I]MEL binding was detectable in the PT of only one of the eight human specimens examined. Specific [125I]MEL binding was also detected in the pars distalis of several subjects, but with an inconsistent distribution. In rhesus monkey tissue, MEL receptors were readily detected in the SCN and, as in all other seasonally breeding species examined to date, in the PT. The relative absence of MEL receptors from the human PT suggests that neuroendocrine

In this study, a small-molecule library was screened for compounds that, in combination with the fluoroquinolone antibiotic ofloxacin, reduced the number of P. aeruginosa persisters compared to the number achieved with treatment with the antibiotic alone. Based on the early structure-activity relationship, 1-((2,4-dichlorophenethyl)amino)-3-phenoxypropan-2-ol (SPI009) was selected for further characterization. Combination of SPI009 with mechanistically distinct classes of antibiotics reduced the number of persisters up to 106-fold in both lab strains and clinical isolates of 	P. aeruginosa	 Further characterization of the compound revealed a direct and efficient killing of persister cells.

The most frequent indication was secondary hydrocephalus, particularly due to obstruction by a tumour, and primary hydrocephalus. They were also used in cases of benign intracranial hypertension, CSF fistulas and arachnoid cysts. Most valves were inserted frontally, under antibiotic prophylaxis. RESULTS: Excluding patients with a follow-up of less than three months, the average follow-up was 14.63 +/- 9.07 months, with clinical improvement in 80%. There was 0% mortality in relation to surgery. The initial average pressure was 121.84 +/- 24.74 mmH2O and after 52 reprogrammings done in 36 (	30%	) of the patients, the final average pressure was 124.96 +/- 30.58 mmH2O. Reprogramming was done for the management of symptoms and to avoid subdural hygromas. We have observed no clinical signs of unprogramming. There were 29 complications which were treated by reprogramming in 7 cases and surgically in the remainder. CONCLUSIONS: We recommend frontal insertion, with a long peritoneal catheter, mainly in patients with hydrocephalus secondary to stenosis of the aqueduct of Sylvius, benign intracranial hypertension, after head injury and Arnold-Chiari malformation. The initial pressure is difficult to determine but tends to be average or high. Reprogramming is particularly useful in

Recent work indicates the same for progressive multiple sclerosis (MS), an inflammatory and degenerative disease of the central nervous system (CNS). The biological pathways associated with these effects are however not well understood. OBJECTIVE: In this randomized controlled study, we explored serum levels of the myokine Irisin, the neurotrophin brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and Interleukin-6 (IL-6) during acute endurance exercise and over the course of a 9-weeks endurance exercise training period in n=42 patients with progressive MS. RESULTS: We detected a significant increase of 	BDNF	 levels in progressive MS patients after 30min of bicycling (p<0.001). However, there were no significant changes for baseline levels after 22 sessions of training. No significant effects of acute or prolonged exercise could be found for Irisin or Interleukin-6. CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that BDNF is strongly induced during acute exercise even in patients with progressive MS and advanced physical disability. Long-term effects of exercise programs on biological parameters (Irisin, BDNF, IL-6) were much less pronounced.

We furthermore found that CD73 protein and its functional activity are strongly increased in fibrous septa in rats subjected to experimental fibrosis. To determine the mechanism for the upregulation of Cd73 gene, we cloned the rat Cd73 promoter and then used serial truncation and site-directed mutagenesis to identify key regulatory elements. We identified two consensus SP1 motifs and one SMAD binding site, each of which was necessary for Cd73 gene upregulation. In 	conclusion	, activated HSC upregulate Cd73 gene expression, via specific SP1 and SMAD promoter elements, after myofibroblastic differentiation.

METHODS: Lean (C57BL/6 J) and obese (LepDb) mice were fed either a soybean oil- or fish oil-rich diet for 4 weeks. AP was induced by six hourly intraperitoneal injections of cerulein (50 mug/kg). Serum adipokine levels were measured, and pancreatitis severity was assessed histologically and by measuring pancreatic concentrations of interleukin-1 beta (IL-1beta), interleukin-6 (	IL-6	), myleoperoxidase (MPO), and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1). RESULTS: Obese mice developed more severe pancreatitis than lean mice. Fish oil significantly decreased serum leptin (lean and obese) and increased serum adiponectin (lean only). Fish oil did not alter the baseline pancreatic inflammatory milieu, nor did it change histologic or biochemical pancreatitis severity. CONCLUSION: These data demonstrate that a diet rich in fish oil altered the adipokine milieu in lean and congenitally obese mice; however, fish oil did not improve pancreatitis severity induced with cerulein hyperstimulation.

11792223	T85	out	reflection absorption infrared spectroscopy, scanning tunneling microscopy, and periodic density functional theory calculations reveals a new mode of chiral induction. At room temperatures and low coverages, (R,R)-tartaric acid is adsorbed in its bitartrate form with two-point bonding to the surface via both carboxylate groups. The molecule is preferentially located above the 4-fold hollow site with each carboxylate functionality adsorbed at the short bridge site via O atoms placed above adjacent Ni atoms. However, repulsive interactions between the chiral OH groups of the molecule and the metal atoms lead to severely strained adsorption on the bulk-truncation Ni(110) surface. As a result, 	the most stable adsorption structure	 is one in which this adsorption-induced stress is alleviated by significant relaxation of surface metal atoms so that a long distance of 7.47 A between pairs of Ni atoms can be accommodated at the surface. Interestingly, this leads the bonding Ni atoms to describe a chiral footprint at the surface for which all local mirror symmetry planes are destroyed. Calculations show only one chiral footprint to be favored by the (R,R)-tartaric acid, with the mirror adsorption site being unstable by 6 kJ mol(-1). This energy difference is sufficient to enable the same local chiral reconstruction and motif to be sustained

Ventricular cycle length was increased dramatically by sotalol, lidocaine and propranolol (+618 +/- 192, +388 +/- 125 and +329 +/- 114 msec, respectively) and QT interval was increased by sotalol, quinidine and flecainide (+56 +/- 8, +31 +/- 7.9 and +20 +/- 5.7 msec, respectively). Quinidine and sotalol, but not flecainide, propranolol or lidocaine, exhibited significant arrhythmogenic activities. During 	quinidine	 infusion, most dogs exhibited some ventricular arrhythmias whose most severe forms were runs of ventricular tachycardia. These arrhythmias were suppressed by pacing at high rates. During sotalol infusion, five out of six dogs exhibited typical "torsades de pointes." This incidence was not related to the slowing effects of sotalol on idioventricular pacemakers, because a similar incidence was obtained in five complementary dogs paced at 40 bpm. It could be related to dose, because torsades de pointes occurred only once in another group of five dogs receiving half the dose used in the controlled study. Only quinidine and sotalol, but not

METHODS: In the current single-center, retrospective study, we enrolled a total of 11 patients (n=11) who were diagnosed with white-eyed blowout fracture and underwent surgical operation at our institution between January 2009 and January 2013. To identify the correlation between the time to surgery and that to recovery from postoperative diplopia, we divided our patients into the three groups: the group A (time to surgery, <2 days) (n=4), the group B (time to surgery, 3-7 days) (n=4) and the group C (n=3) (time to surgery, 8-60 days). Then, we compared 	such variables	 as sex, age, signs of soft tissue injury, preoperative nausea/vomiting, the degree of preoperative diplopia and the side of the fracture on computed tomography scans between the three groups. RESULTS: In our series, mean age at the onset of trauma was nine years (range, 5-16 years); the mean time to surgery was 30 days (range, 2-60 days); and the mean follow-up period was one year (range, 6 months-2 years). Our results showed that the time to recovery was shorter in the patients with a shorter time to surgery. CONCLUSIONS: We found that the degree of recovery from impaired ocular motility

We evaluated changes in maximal voluntary contraction (MVC) and speed of contraction (S) in response to cholecalciferol by using an hand held dynamometer at 3, 15, 30, 60 and 90 days, compared to baseline. RESULTS: We observed no significant change in MVC and S values, a significant increase of 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D [1,25(OH)2D] and a significant decrease in serum parathyroid hormone (PTH) (p<0.001 for all). A significant correlation was found between MVC and S and serum phosphorus (P) after supplementation (p<0.02 and p<0.05, respectively). Conversely, we observed no association between the parameters of muscle strength and 	25(OH)D	, ionized calcium (Ca2+), PTH and 1,25(OH)2D. CONCLUSIONS: A single dose of 600,000 IU of cholecalciferol does not directly enhance handgrip strength in young women with vitamin D deficiency. More studies are needed on the indirect effect of the hormone on muscle. DOCEND

Widespread expression of the alpha-subunit of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF-1alpha) was observed in samples of human oral squamous cell carcinoma. In all the cases, this was accompanied by a widespread distribution of nitric oxide (NO) synthases (NOS). Furthermore, in three human cell lines derived from human oral squamous cell carcinoma, the accumulation of HIF-1alpha was prevented either by inhibition of NOS activity with the nonspecific NOS inhibitor N(G)-monomethyl-L-arginine or by the antioxidants N-acetyl-L-cysteine and ascorbic acid.

Genital responses to erotic film and fantasy were recorded from 10 women at five phases of the menstrual cycle by means of vaginal photoplethysmography. Relationships between baseline (prestimulation) and difference (stimulation minus prestimulation) levels of response were examined. Neither vaginal blood volume nor average pulse amplitude conformed to the law of initial value ("the higher the baseline level, the less will be the difference score"). Baseline levels and difference scores generally were positively correlated at each phase of the menstrual cycle in the case of average pulse amplitude. For 	blood volume	 the correlations between baseline levels and difference scores were inconsistent in direction and small in magnitude, but trends differed between phases of the menstrual cycle.

Adenomatous polyposis coli is also localized in the astrocytic processes in the cerebellar granular layer, and displays concentrated expression in the terminal plexuses of the basket cell fibres around Purkinje cells. Adenomatous polyposis coli is further expressed in neuronal cell bodies and/or nerve fibres in the olfactory bulb, hippocampus, brain stem, spinal cord and dorsal root ganglia. Adenomatous polyposis coli is demonstrated to be co-localized with beta-catenin and/or 	hDLG	 in neurons and nerve fibres, but not in astrocytes. From these results, adenomatous polyposis coli is suggested to participate in a signal transduction pathway in astrocytes which is independent of beta-catenin and hDLG, and also in regulation of neuronal functions in association with beta-catenin and hDLG.

Surprisingly, for immune precipitates composed of Facb fragments or IgG in which the inter-heavy-chain disulphide bond had been selectively reduced and alkylated, stronger binding (K = 30 nM) was observed. In this case, however, changes in the structure of the immune-complex matrix were also detected. These structural changes may account for the strengthening of the C1q-immune-complex interaction, which can be strongly influenced by the flexibility and the binding-site pattern of the immune-complex precipitates. 	These results	 suggest that domain-domain interactions in the Fc part of IgG affect the segmental mobility of IgG molecules and the spatial arrangement of the immune-complex matrix rather than the affinity of individual C1q-binding sites on IgG.

Fluorescence-activated cell sorting was used to obtain highly purified cultures of embryonic stem cells (ESCs), primitive germ cells (PGCs), and spermatogonial stem cells (SSCs). The total RNA was then extracted from each type of cell. High-throughput analysis methods (RNA-seq) were used to sequence the transcriptome of these cells. Gene Ontology (GO) analysis and the KEGG database were used to identify lipid metabolism pathways and related genes. Retinoic acid (RA), the end-product of the 	retinol	 metabolism pathway, induced in vitro differentiation of ESC into male germ cells. Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) was used to detect changes in the expression of the genes involved in the retinol metabolic pathways. From the results of RNA-seq and the database analyses, we concluded that there are 328 genes in 27 lipid metabolic pathways continuously involved in lipid metabolism during the differentiation of ESC into SSC in vivo, including retinol metabolism.

Many studies have reported causes of paralysis, but few reports have shown changes in longitudinal etiology in a single institution. METHODS: We investigated the medical records of 797 patients with vocal fold paralysis from 1990 to 2005 at the voice and bronchoesophageal outpatient clinics at the University of Tokyo Hospital. We evaluated 	the etiology	 of paralysis, and compared our results with a previous study by Hirose in our clinic from 1961 to 1989 to assess changes in etiology. RESULTS: The postoperative group comprised 466 patients (58.5%), while the non-surgical group comprised 331 (41.5%) patients. In the postoperative group, the most common cause of paralysis was thyroid surgery (106 cases), and other common causes were surgery for aortic aneurysm (61 cases) and tracheal intubation (58 cases). In the non-surgical group, idiopathic paralysis (134 cases) was the most common cause. Other common causes were lung cancer (34 cases) and cerebrovascular disease (24 cases). In a previous

Phosphomimetic AnxA2 carrying a mutant phosphoacceptor (AnxA2-Y24D-GFP) enhanced surface expression and raft association of NKCC2 by 5-fold upon low chloride hypotonic stimulation, whereas AnxA2-Y24A-GFP and PKC-dependent AnxA2-S26D-GFP did not. As the AnxA2 effect involved only nonphosphorylated NKCC2, it appears to affect NKCC2 trafficking. Overexpression or knockdown experiments further supported the role of AnxA2 in the apical translocation and surface expression of 	NKCC2	. In summary, this study identifies AnxA2 as a lipid raft-associated trafficking factor for NKCC2 and provides mechanistic insight into the regulation of this essential cotransporter. DOCEND

The extraction was undertaken at the extracting pressure of 4000-5000 psi, the extracting temperature of 40-45 degrees C, and the carbon dioxide flow rate of 2.0 mL/min for 90 min. An optimized pretreatment of wheat germ was usually necessary with a particle size of 30 mesh and a moisture content of 5.1%.

Using available three-dimensional structural information and computational biology, homology models of human IFN-alpha1, human IFN-alpha8, IFN alfacon-1, and murine IFN-alpha4 were derived and docked with the extracellular region of human IFNAR2 to evaluate the behavior of potential interacting residue pairs and characterize the nature of the IFN-IFNAR2 binding interfaces. The data suggest that IFN afacon-1 has 9 optimal interactions with IFNAR2, comprising hydrophobic, electrostatic, and hydrogen bonding. Human IFN-alpha2 exhibits 8 optimal interactions, 	human	 IFN-alpha1, 7, and murine IFN-alpha4 exhibits the least number of optimal interactions, at 5. A model of IFNAR1 was generated, taking into consideration the IFNAR1 extracellular domain interaction with cell surface glycosphingolipids, putative ligand interaction residues, and residues stabilizing the structural integrity of IFNAR. IFNAR1 was then docked with the various IFN-IFNAR2 complexes to describe the complete extracellular receptor pocket with bound IFN. These data provide insights into the species specificity of IFN-alphas: residues in murine IFN-alpha4 that preclude strong affinity interactions with human IFNAR because of steric crowding and residues in human IFN-alpha8 that resemble a receptor interactive domain

In contrast, there is no preferential release of MeAde during digestion of purified DNA. These results indicate that MeAde residues are predominantly located in "linker DNA" and perhaps have a function in transcription. Pulse-chase studies showed that labeled MeAde remains preferentially in linker DNA during subsequent rounds of DNA replication; i.e., there is little, if any, movement of

The other six isoforms are highly sensitive to TTX with IC50 values in the nanomolar range. These isoforms are expressed in the central nervous system (Nav1.1, Nav1.2, Nav1.3, Nav1.6), in the skeletal muscle (Nav1.4), and in the peripheral nervous system (Nav1.6, Nav1.7).

Endothelial cells possess several mechanisms for altering circulating levels of adenosine and are capable of release of adenosine metabolites. We used cultured bovine aortic and main pulmonary arterial endothelial cells to determine whether endotoxin can alter adenosine uptake or release of adenosine metabolites. We found that 24 hours, but not 6 hours, of incubation with endotoxin caused endothelial cell injury, as assessed by 	cell detachment	 and chromium 51 release. Despite this injury the extent of [3H]adenosine uptake was unchanged. Using thin-layer chromatography to identify adenosine and its metabolites, we found that [3H]adenosine was primarily metabolized into intracellular hypoxanthine and adenine nucleotides. After 1, 6, and 24 hours of incubation with endotoxin there was an increase in extracellular adenosine metabolites, which was accompanied by decreases in the level of intracellular adenosine 5'-triphosphate. The appearance of adenosine metabolites in culture supernatants was a more sensitive measure of endothelial cell injury than 51Cr release or adherent cell number.

29424025	T26	che	DOCSTART Nrf2-mediated neuroprotection against oxygen-glucose deprivation/reperfusion injury by emodin via AMPK-dependent inhibition of GSK-3beta. OBJECTIVES: Our study verified the neuroprotective properties of emodin against oxygen-glucose deprivation/reoxygenation (OGD/R) and demonstrated its mechanism. METHODS: Human neuronal SH-SY5Y cells were investigated by analysing cell viability, lactate dehydrogenase levels, expression of molecules related to apoptotic cell death, and using biochemical techniques, flow cytometry and Western blot assays. KEY FINDINGS: Emodin reduced OGD/R-lead to neurotoxicity in SH-SY5Y cells. OGD/R significantly increased levels of cleaved 	poly ADP ribose	 polymerase, cleaved caspase-3, cleaved caspase-9, p53, p21 and Bax protein. However, emodin treatment effectively inhibited these OGD/R-induced changes. Emodin treatment also increased HO-1 and NQO1 expression in a concentration- and time-dependent manner and caused antioxidant response element (ARE) transcription activity and nuclear Nrf2 accumulation. Emodin phosphorylated AMPK and GSK3beta, and pretreatment of cells with an AMPK inhibitor suppressed emodin-induced nuclear Nrf2 accumulation and HO-1 and NQO1 expression. AMPK inhibitor treatment decreased GSK3beta phosphorylation, suggesting that AMPK is upstream of GSK3beta, Nrf2, HO-1 and NQO1. Emodin's neuroprotective effect was completely blocked by HO-1, NQO1 and Nrf2 knock-down and an AMPK inhibitor,

Since the function of these proteins may only be required transiently, a regulatory mechanism for transcriptionally and/or post-translationally regulate their expression should exist. In general during stress, molecular mechanisms aimed at shutting down the ABA-dependent signaling, as required at some point for the homeostasis of the plant cell, are poorly understood. The arabidopsis TSPO (translocator protein)-related protein is transiently induced by abiotic stresses and ABA treatment. Our recent work aiming at understanding the function and regulation of At-TSPO yielded 	exciting insights	 into the interplay among a stress-regulated protein, ABA responses, tetrapyrrole biosynthesis/scavenging, and autophagy.

METHODS: A list of HH pathogenic variants in publically available next-generation sequence (NGS) databases was compiled and allele frequencies were determined. RESULTS: Of 161 variants previously associated with HH, 43 were represented among the NGS data sets; an additional 40 unreported functional variants also were identified. The predicted prevalence of HFE HH and the p.Cys282Tyr mutation closely matched previous estimates from similar populations. Of the non-HFE forms of iron overload, TFR2-, HFE2-, and HAMP-related forms are predicted to be rare, with pathogenic allele frequencies in the range of 0.00007 to 0.0005. Significantly, 	SLC40A1	 variants that have been previously associated with autosomal-dominant ferroportin disease were identified in several populations (pathogenic allele frequency 0.0004), being most prevalent among Africans. CONCLUSION: We have, for the first time, estimated the population prevalence of non-HFE HH.

We used differential screening of cDNAs from individual taste receptor cells to identify candidate taste transduction elements in mice. Among the differentially expressed clones, 	one	 encoded Trpm5, a member of the mammalian family of transient receptor potential (TRP) channels. We found Trpm5 to be expressed in a restricted manner, with particularly high levels in taste tissue. In taste cells, Trpm5 was coexpressed with taste-signaling molecules such as alpha-gustducin, Ggamma13, phospholipase C-beta2 (PLC-beta2) and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor type III (IP3R3). Our heterologous expression studies of Trpm5 indicate that it functions as a cationic channel that is gated when internal calcium stores are depleted. Trpm5 may be responsible for capacitative calcium entry in taste receptor cells that respond to bitter and/or sweet compounds. DOCEND

By utilizing live and dead cell counts, cell cycle characterizations, and calculations of rates of entry into S phase and mitosis, it was demonstrated that dilute culture conditions (2 X 10(5) cells/ml) enable lymphocytes to proliferate for a period of 5 or 6 days.

RESULTS: Sixty-two patients were included: 53 with ;practice-definite' and nine with ;practice-possible' diagnoses of MS. At the time of diagnosis, 47% of the ;practice-definite' group fulfilled the 2001 criteria and 49% the revised criteria. Among patients not satisfying the criteria at time of diagnosis, 21% went on to fulfil the McDonald criteria over the 23-month follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: There is a considerable gap between the clinical diagnosis of MS in a general neurology setting and compliance with the McDonald criteria. 	Failure	 to perform follow-up MRI on patients with clinically isolated syndromes is a sizeable factor in this diagnostic-gap and needs to be improved. In this setting, practical differences between the original and revised criteria appear to be small. DOCEND

The goal of present study was to test whether sleep apnea contributes to the previously reported increases of IL-6 and TNF-alpha independent of obesity. Forty-three obese (body mass index, BMI>27 kg/m2) men with newly diagnosed obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) (apnea-hypopnea index, AHI> or =5) and age- and BMI-matched 22 obese nonapneic male controls (AHI<5) were enrolled in this study.

This study was designed to identify which cells express major histocompatibility complex class II (Ia) antigen in experimental autoimmune neuritis and may therefore be antigen presenters. Serial 1-micron-thick cryosections of ventral roots of animals with experimental autoimmune neuritis were labeled with Ox6 antibody against rat Ia, the ED1 antibody to identify monocytes/macrophages and an antiserum against S100, a marker for Schwann cells. Ia-positive cells were predominantly present before 	overt clinical signs	 and demyelination (day 12). At later stages when many axons were demyelinated, their number was markedly reduced. Few Ia-positive cells that had extending long processes, which over some distance were in immediate contact with several myelin sheaths, were scattered in normal-appearing nerve roots at these later time points. Most of the Ia-positive cells could be identified as ED1-positive lean monocytes/macrophages, but in contrast most phagocytic macrophages in advanced stages of myelin degradation no longer expressed Ia. Ia-positive structures were invariably negative for S100 at early and late stages of experimental autoimmune neuritis, indicating that Schwann cells did not express identifiable

All developmental research needs to carefully consider how children's knowledge is measured. The study of children's knowledge of spelling conventions, or the ways in which the English orthography encodes the 	roots and affixes	 and the sounds in words, is no exception. This experiment examined the extent of 7- to 9-year-old children's knowledge of the role of root morphemes in spelling words across different contexts and with different units of assessment. Different writing contexts did not appear to affect children's performance; children were better able to spell the first components of two- than of one-morpheme words (e.g. only free in freely and freeze), both when writing whole words and their first sections (e.g. completing__ or __ly for freely). A second analysis revealed that the unit of coding can influence conclusions. Children demonstrated similar abilities

INTRODUCTION: The rat model of postinfarction heart failure (HF) has been very valuable in experimental cardiology. One disadvantage of this model is the very high acute mortality (70-80%). The aim of this study was to evaluate whether measures of intensive cardiac care applied to rats with acute myocardial infarction (MI) would reduce mortality. METHODS: Male Sprague-Dawley rats weighing approximately 300 g were used. The animals were randomized into two groups. The intensive care group (IC) n=20 and conventional care group (CC) n=20. Experimental MI was induced by ligation of the left coronary artery producing

BACKGROUND: Differential diagnosis of hydatidiform moles from non-molar specimens as well as their sub-classification such as complete and partial hydatidiform moles are important for clinical management and accurate risk assessment for persistent gestational trophoblastic disease, but diagnosis based solely on histomorphology suffers from poor interobserver and intraobserver reproducibility. OBJECTIVES: This study was undertaken to determine whether the expression of Ki-67 protein could differentiate these entities. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed Ki-67 immunohistochemical staining in 19 molar (8 partial and 11 complete moles) and 10 non-molar (hydropic abortions) 	formalin	-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue samples. Ploidy analysis using flow cytometry had confirmed diploidy in hydropic abortions and complete moles and triploidy in partial moles. RESULTS: Ki-67 immunoreactivity was assessed in villous cytotrophoblasts, syncytiotrophoblasts and stromal cells. Positive cells were found to be restricted mostly to the villous cytotrophoblasts, while syncytiotrophoblasts showed an absence of immunostaining for Ki-67, and occasional weak nuclear staining was seen in the stromal cells. There was a significant difference in Ki-67 immunoreactivity of cytotrophoblastic cells between hydropic abortions and complete moles (P < 0.001), hydropic abortions and partial moles (P = 0.002) and also between complete and partial moles

Urine eosinophil protein X (EPX) levels after exercise were measured by using ELISA method. EIB was observed in 195 of 268 asthmatics (72.8%). Asthmatics with EIB showed significantly increased TEC (P < 0.01) and decreased log PC(20) as compared with asthmatics without EIB. Maximal percent fall in FEV(1) after exercise was significantly correlated with TEC, log IgE, FEF(25-75%), log PC(20) (P < 0.001, respectively) and FEV(1) (	P = 0.013	). When the same study was carried out in nonatopic asthmatics, those with EIB showed significantly increased TEC (P = 0.01) compared with those without EIB; however, log PC(20), FEV(1), and FEF(25-75%) showed no significant differences between the two groups of nonatopic asthmatics. In addition, there was a significant correlation between the severity of EIB and TEC in nonatopic asthmatics. Urine EPX/Cr levels after exercise were correlated with the severity of EIB (r = 0.238, P = 0.014). Blood eosinophils and urine EPX/Cr after exercise correlate significantly with the maximal percent fall in FEV(1) after exercise, therefore EIB may reflect a state of eosinophilic

Over-expression of IRSp53 in C2C12 cells led to induction of filopodia and decrease in cell adhesion, concomitantly with inhibition of myogenic differentiation. In contrast, knocking down the IRSp53 expression in C2C12 cells led to a small but significant increase in myotube development. The decreased cell adhesion of C2C12 cells over-expressing IRSp53 is correlated with a reduction in the number of vinculin patches in these cells. Mutations in the conserved IMD domain (	IRSp53	 and MIM (missing in metastasis) homology domain) or SH3 domain of IRSp53 abolished the ability of this protein to inhibit myogenic differentiation and reduce cell adhesion. Over-expression of the IMD domain alone was sufficient to decrease the cell-extracellular matrix adhesion and to inhibit myogenesis in a manner dependent on its function in membrane shaping. Based on our data, we propose that IRSp53 is a negative regulator of myogenic differentiation which correlates with the observed down regulation of IRSp53 expression during myoblast differentiation to myotubes.

Interpretation of the results of endoscopic stenting must be made with reference to the level of the bile duct obstruction. Results were generally unsatisfactory for hilar lesions, especially when the intrahepatic ducts were segregated into multiple isolated systems. After deployment, stent dysfunction due to 	clogging	 by biliary sludge is apparently an inevitable process for the conventional plastic stent. Considerable efforts had been made to prolong the stent patency by changing its physical configuration, coating the inner lumen, and the choice of material but with little success. The development of a self-expandable metal stent is a major advance, but the benefits derived from a larger stent lumen are compromised by the initial expense and the tumor ingrowth through the wires for all models available commercially. Current data failed to substantiate the value of routine preoperative biliary decompression, as there is no reduction in the morbidity and

Expression of CD59 and CD16 did not differ between the two groups. These changes may increase adhesiveness and complement resistance of PMN in SF compared with blood. PMN from RA expressed significantly less of all the complement C3 convertase regulators (CD55, CD46, CD35), all the adhesion molecules (CD11a, CD11b, CD18) and the phosphatase CD45 than did blood PMN from age and sex-matched control individuals.

Ascorbic acid (AsA), the most abundant antioxidant in plants, is regenerated by the action of monodehydroascorbate reductase (MDAR) and dehydroascorbate reductase (DHAR). We investigated the role of MDAR and DHAR in AsA regeneration during Al stress using transgenic tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) plants overexpressing Arabidopsis cytosolic MDAR (MDAR-OX) or DHAR (DHAR-OX).

Over the past 15 years, research in the field of microfluidics has experienced rapid growth due to significant potential advantages such as low cost, short analysis times, and elimination of sources of contamination. Although etched and thermally bonded glass substrates have seen widespread use and offer 	solid performance	, device fabrication still remains cumbersome. Recent advances in sacrificial layer microfabrication methods for microfluidics have overcome many disadvantages of conventional fabrication approaches. Phase-changing sacrificial layers have been implemented in making inexpensive and high-performance polymer microchips for electrophoretic analysis, protein focusing, and sample preconcentration. In addition, novel channel fabrication methods based on standard thin-film processes, which are readily integratable with microfabrication techniques used for electrical components, are being applied increasingly for the creation of microfluidic devices. These new sacrificial layer fabrication approaches will be instrumental in making low-cost and high-quality polymer microchips, and in interfacing electrical and fluidic systems on glass

We cloned a zebrafish numb homologue (znumb) by searching database. znumb shows approximately 60% identity with mammalian Numb orthologs. Interstingly, znumb lacks two specific sequence motifs unique to Numbl orthologs. However, chromosomal localization of znumb gene revealed colinearity with genes located around mouse and human Numbl genes. Furthermore, multi-species comparisons of conserved phosphotyrosine-binding (PTB) domain sequences in Numb and Numbl proteins suggest that znumb is more closely related to 	Numbl	 than Numb. znumb mRNA was expressed in a wide variety of zebrafish adult tissues. Overexpression of znumb in embryos resulted in an absence, or reversal, of the normal leftward shift of the developing heart tube. Furthermore, no or bi-lateral transcripts of lefty2 were observed in znumb-expressing embryos, suggesting that the Notch signaling was essential for left-right field formation and maintenance in zebrafish, and that znumb perturbed this process through down-regulation of endogenous Notch signaling.

Plasma acetate and 	beta-hydroxybutyrate	 decreased, whereas glucose, nonesterified fatty acids, and leptin increased with high-concentrate diets. Milk fat percentage was lower in cows fed high-concentrate diets (2.31 vs. 3.38), resulting in decreases in yield of 11 (HC) and 42% (HCO). Reduced yields of 8:0-16:0 and cis9-18:1 fatty acids accounted for 69 and 17%, respectively, of the decrease in milk fat yield with HC vs. LC (-90 g/d), and for 26 and 33%, respectively, of the decrease with HCO vs. LCO (-400 g/d). Total trans-18:1 yield increased by 25 (HCO) and 59 (LCO) g/d with oil addition. Trans10-18:1 yield was 5-fold greater with high-concentrate diets.

The CD spectra of these peptides are largely random coil in 2 mM sodium phosphate buffer (pH 5.5) and show a conformational change to alpha-helix with increasing 	methanol	 content. Singular value decomposition was used to correct the CD spectra for the absorbing side chains of W, Y, F, C, and M, and this correction can be substantial. With correction both W and F become good helix formers. The free energy for helix propagation was calculated using the Lifson-Roig statistical model for each of the nineteen amino acids at each point in their titration. The results show that the rank order of helical propensity for the nineteen amino acids changes with solvent environment. This result will be particularly important if proteins undergo hydrophobic collapse before secondary structures are formed,
